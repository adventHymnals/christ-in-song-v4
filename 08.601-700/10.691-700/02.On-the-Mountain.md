        Christ in Song 692. On the Mountain. I am dwelling on the mountain, Where the golden sunlight gleams O'er a land whose wondrous beauty Far exceeds my fondest dreams, Where the air is pure ethereal, Laden with the breath of flow'rs. They are blooming by th' fountain, Neath the amarinthin' bow'rs.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I am dwelling on the mountain,
Where the golden sunlight gleams
O'er a land whose wondrous beauty
Far exceeds my fondest dreams,
Where the air is pure ethereal,
Laden with the breath of flow'rs.
They are blooming by th' fountain,
Neath the amarinthin' bow'rs.

2.
I can see far down the pathway,
Where I wandered weary years,
Often hindered in my journey
By the ghosts of doubts and fears;
Broken vows and disappointments
Thickly lie along the way;
But the Spirit gently led me
To the land I hold to-day.

3.
I am drinking at the fountain,
Where I ever would abide;
For I've tasted life's pure river,
And my soul is satisfied;
There's no thirst for worldly pleasures,
Nor adorning rich and gay.
For I've found a greater treasure,
One that fadeth not away.

4.
Is not this the land of Beulah,
Blessed land of love and light,
Where the flowers blooom forever,
And the sun is always bright?
Yes, I've reached the land of Beulah,
Blessed land of love and light.
Here the flowers bloom forever.
And the sun is always bright.
