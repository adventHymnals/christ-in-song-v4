## 698. SPEED THY SERVANTS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Speed thy servants, Saviour, speed them;
Thou art Lord of winds and waves:
They were bound, but thou hast freed them;
Now they go to free the slaves;
Be thou with them, be thou with them;
'Tis thine arm alone that saves.

2.
Friends and home and all forsaking,
Lord, they go at thy command,
As their stay thy promise taking,
While they traverse sea and land
O, be with them, O, be with them;
Lead them safely by the hand.

2.
Where no fruit appears to cheer them,
And they seem to toil in vain.
Then in mercy, Lord, draw near them,
Then their sinking hopes sustain;
Thus supported, Thus supported
Bid their zeal revive again.

3.
In the midst of opposition
May they trust, O Lord in thee:
When success attends their mission,
May thy servants humble be;
Never leave them, Never leave them,
Till thy face in heav'n they see.
