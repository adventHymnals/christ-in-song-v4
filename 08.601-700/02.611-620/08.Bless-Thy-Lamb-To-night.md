####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,
Bless Thy little lamb to-night;
Thro' the darkness be Thou near me,
Keep me safe till morning light.

2.
All this day Thy hand has led me,
And I thank Thee for Thy care,
Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me,
Listen to my evening pray'r.

3.
May my sins be all forgiven,
Bless the friends I love so well,
Take us all at last to heaven,
Happy there with Thee to dwell.

```
