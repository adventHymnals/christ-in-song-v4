####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
When morning lights the eastern skies,
Thy mercy, Lord, disclose;
And let Thy loving kindness rise;
On Thee my hopes repose.

Refrain:
On Thee my hopes repose,
On Thee my hopes repose,
And let Thy loving kindness rise;
On Thee my hopes repose.

2.
Teach me the way where I should go;
I lift my soul to Thee;
Redeem me from the raging foe;
To Thee, O Lord, I flee.  [Refrain]

3.
Because Thou art my God, I pray,
Teach me to do Thy will;
O lead me in the perfect way,
By Thy good Spirit still.  [Refrain]

4.
Revive me, Lord, for Thy great name,
And for Thy judgment's sake;
From all my woes, O lord, reclaim,
My soul from trouble take.  [Refrain]
