        Christ in Song 616. Call Them In. "Call them in", the wretched, Sin-stained wand'rers from the field; Peace and pardon freely offer; Can you weigh their worth with gold; "Call them in," the weak the weary, Laden with the doom of sin; Bid them come and rest in Jesus; He is waiting, "Call them in."

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
"Call them in", the wretched,
Sin-stained wand'rers from the field;
Peace and pardon freely offer;
Can you weigh their worth with gold;
"Call them in," the weak the weary,
Laden with the doom of sin;
Bid them come and rest in Jesus;
He is waiting, "Call them in."

2.
"Call them in", the Jew, the Gentile;
Bid the stranger to the feast:
"Call them in", the rich, the noble,
From the highest to the least:
Forth the Father runs to meet them,
He hath all their sorrows seen;
Robe, and ring, and royal sandals,
Wait the lost ones, "Call them in."

3.
"Call them in", the mere professors,
Slumbering, sleeping, on death's brink;
Naught of life are they possessors,
Yet of safety vainly think:
Bring them in, the careless scoffers,
Pleasure seekers of the earth:
Tell of God's most gracious offers,
And of Jesus' priceless worth.

4.
"Call them in", the broken-hearted,
Cowering 'neath the brand of shame;
Speak love's message low and tender,
'Twas for sinners Jesus came:
See, the shadows lengthen round us,
Soon the day dawn will begin;
Can you leave them lost and lonely?
Christ is coming, "Call them in."
