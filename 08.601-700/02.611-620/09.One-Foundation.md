####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The Church has one foundation,
'Tis Jesus Christ her Lord;
She is His new creation,
By water and the word;
From heav'n He came and sought her
To be His holy bride,
With His own blood He bo't her,
And for her life He died.

2.
Elect from ev'ry nation,
Yet one o'er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation,
One Lord, one faith, one birth;
One holy name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
With ev'ry grace endued.

3.
Tho' with a scornful wonder,
Men see her sore opprest,
Tho' foes would rend asunder
The rock where she doth rest;
Yet saints their faith are keeping,
Their cry goes up, "How long?"
And soon the night of weeping
Shall be the morn of song.

4.
'Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace for ever more;
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the Church at rest.
