        Christ in Song 617. A Cry from Macedonia. There's a cry from Macedonia  Come and help us, The light of the precious gospel bring, Let us hear the joyful tidings of salvation, We thirst for the living spring. O, ye heralds of the cross, be up and doing, Remember the Saviour's great command, Go ye forth and preach the word to ev'ry creature, Proclaim it in ev'ry land.  Chorus: They shall gather from the East, They shall gather from the West, With the patriarchs of old. And the ransom'd shall return To the kingdom of the blest, With their harps and crowns of gold. There's a cry from Macedonia  Come and help us, The light of the precious gospel bring, Let us hear the joyful tidings of salvation, We thirst for the living spring. O, ye heralds of the cross, be up and doing, Remember the Saviour's great command, Go ye forth and preach the word to ev'ry creature, Proclaim it in ev'ry land.

1.
There's a cry from Macedonia  Come and help us,
The light of the precious gospel bring,
Let us hear the joyful tidings of salvation,
We thirst for the living spring.
O, ye heralds of the cross, be up and doing,
Remember the Saviour's great command,
Go ye forth and preach the word to ev'ry creature,
Proclaim it in ev'ry land. 

Chorus:
They shall gather from the East,
They shall gather from the West,
With the patriarchs of old.
And the ransom'd shall return
To the kingdom of the blest,
With their harps and crowns of gold.
There's a cry from Macedonia  Come and help us,
The light of the precious gospel bring,
Let us hear the joyful tidings of salvation,
We thirst for the living spring.
O, ye heralds of the cross, be up and doing,
Remember the Saviour's great command,
Go ye forth and preach the word to ev'ry creature,
Proclaim it in ev'ry land.

2.
O how beautiful their feet upon the mountains,
The tidings of peace from God who bring,
To the nations of the earth who sit in darkness,
And tell them of Zion's King.
Then, ye heralds of the cross, be up and doing,
Go work in your blessed Master's field,
Sound the trumpet, sound the trumpet of salvation,
The Lord is your strength and shield.

Chorus:
Let the distant isles be glad,
Let them hail the Saviour's birth,
And the news of pardon free,
Till the knowledge of the truth
Shall extend to all the earth, 
As the waters o'er the sea.
There's a cry from Macedonia  Come and help us,
The light of the precious gospel bring,
Let us hear the joyful tidings of salvation,
We thirst for the living spring.
O, ye heralds of the cross, be up and doing,
Remember the Saviour's great command,
Go ye forth and preach the word to ev'ry creature,
Proclaim it in ev'ry land.
