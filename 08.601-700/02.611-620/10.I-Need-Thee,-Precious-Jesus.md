## 620. I NEED THEE, PRECIOUS JESUS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I need Thee, precious Jesus,
For I am very poor;
A stranger and a pilgrim,
I have no earthly store.
I need the love of Jesus
To cheer me on my way,
To guide my doubting footsteps,
To be my strength and stay.

2.
I need the heart of Jesus
To feel each anxious care,
To tell my ev'ry trial,
And all my sorrows share.
I need the Holy Spirit
To teach me what I am,
To show me more of Jesus,
To point me to the Lamb.

3.
I need Thee, precious Jesus,
I hope to see Thee soon,
Encircled with the rainbow,
And seated on Thy throne.
There, with Thy blood-bought children,
My joy shall ever be
To sing Thy ceaseless praises,
To gaze, my Lord, on Thee!  Amen.
