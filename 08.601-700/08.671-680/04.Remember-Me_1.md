#### Advent Hymnals
## 674. REMEMBER ME_1
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
When storms of life are sweeping,
When lonely watch I'm keeping,
When floods of ill are falling,
And tempter voices calling,

Chorus:  
Remember me, O Mighty One!
Remember me, O Mighty One!

2.
When walking on life's ocean,
Control its raging motion;
When from its dangers shrinking,
When 'neath the billows sinking.  [Chorus]

3.
When weight of care oppresses,
When thought of sin distresses;
Through all the life that's mortal,
And when I pass death's portal.  [Chorus]

```
