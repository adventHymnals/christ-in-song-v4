## 672. LOVE'S INCENSE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Master, no offering  
Costly or sweet,
Lay we, like Magdalene,
Here at Thy feet;
Yet may love's incense rise,
Sweeter than sacrifice,
Dear Lord, to Thee, 
Dear Lord, to Thee.

2.
Daily our lives would show
Weakness made strong,
Toilsome and gloomy ways
Brightened with song;
Some deeds of kindness done,
Some souls by patience won,
Dear Lord, to Thee, 
Dear Lord, to Thee.

3.
Some word of hope, for hearts
Burdened with fears,
Some balm of peace, for eyes
Blinded with tears,
Some dews of mercy shed,
Some wayward footsteps led,
Dear Lord, To Thee, 
Dear Lord, to Thee.

4.
Thus, in Thy service, Lord,
Till eventide 
Closes the day of life,
May we abide.
And when earth's labor's cease,
Bid us depart in peace,
Dear Lord, to Thee, 
Dear Lord, to Thee.
