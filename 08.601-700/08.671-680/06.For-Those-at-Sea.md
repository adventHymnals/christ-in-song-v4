## 676. FOR THOSE AT SEA
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Eternal Father!  strong to save,
Whose arm doth bind the restless wave,
Who bidst the mighty ocean deep
Its own appointed limits keep:
O hear us when we cry to thee
For those in peril on the sea!

2.
O Saviour!  whose almighty word
The winds and waves submissive heard,
Who walkedst on the foaming deep,
And calm amidst its rage didst sleep:
O hear us when, etc.

3.
O Sacred Spirit!  who didst brood
Upon the chaos dark and rude,
Who bad'st its angry tumult cease,
And gavest light and life and peace:
O hear us when, etc.
