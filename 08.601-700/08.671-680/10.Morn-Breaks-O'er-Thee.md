        Christ in Song 680. Morn Breaks O'er Thee. Christian, the morn breaks sweetly o'er thee And all the midnight shadows flee; Ting'd are the distant skies with glory, A beacon light hangs out for thee. Arise!  arise!  the light breaks o'er thee, Thy name is graven on the throne; Thy home is in that world of glory Where thy Redeemer reigns alone.

1.
Christian, the morn breaks sweetly o'er thee
And all the midnight shadows flee;
Ting'd are the distant skies with glory,
A beacon light hangs out for thee.
Arise!  arise!  the light breaks o'er thee,
Thy name is graven on the throne;
Thy home is in that world of glory
Where thy Redeemer reigns alone.

2.
Toss'd on the rude, relentless surges,
Calmly compos'd and dauntless, stand;
For lo, beyond these scenes emerges
The hights that bound the promis'd land.
Behold!  behold!  the land is nearing,
Where storms of evil rage no more;
Hark, how the heav'nly hosts are cheering!
See in what throngs they range the shore.

3.
Cheer up, cheer up, the day breaks o'er thee,
Bright as the summer's noontide ray;
The starry crowns and realms of glory
Invite thy happy soul away.
Away!  away!  leave all for glory,
Thy name is graven on the throne,
Thy home is in that world of beauty
Where thy Redeemer reigns alone.
