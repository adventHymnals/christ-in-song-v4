####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O Holy Saviour, Friend unseen,
Since on Thine arm Thou bidds't me lean,
Help me, thro'out life's varying scene,
By faith to cling to Thee.

2.
Blest with this fellowship Divine,
Take what Thou wilt, I'll ne'er repine;
E'en as the branches to the vine,
My soul would cling to Thee.

3.
What tho' the world deceitful prove,
And earthly friends and joys remove,
With patient, uncomplaining love
Still would I cling to Thee.

4.
Blest is my lot, whate'er befall;
What can disturb me, who appall,
While as my strength, my Rock, my All,
Saviour, I cling to Thee?
