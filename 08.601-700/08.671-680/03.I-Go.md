## 673. I GO
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Answer the call, ye brave men,
The Master's call to save men;
Each moment death is gaining,
Their blood our garments staining:

Chorus:
Who'll go?  who'll go, whate'er the cost?
Who'll go?  who'll go to save the lost?

2.
Lighting the world with glory,
Once more the gospel story
In purity and pow'r
Proclaims the judgment hour:  [Chorus]

3.
Nations afar are waking,
Their idol shrines forsaking;
God's truth puts on its splendor,
Immanuel its defender:  [Chorus]

4.
Bearing the name of Jesus,
Whose great salvation frees us,
With joy the good news carry, 
Nor dare to longer tarry:  [Chorus]

5.
Where icy winds are crying,
Where India's poor are dying,
Where Southern seas are sleeping,
Where Western isles are weeping.  

Chorus:  I go, I go, whate'er the cost;
I go, I go to save the lost.
