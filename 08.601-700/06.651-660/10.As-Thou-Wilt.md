####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
My Jesus, as thou wilt:
O may thy will be mine!
Into thy hand of love 
I would, my all resign.
Thro' sorrow or thro' joy,
Conduct me as thine own,
And help me still to say,
"My Lord, thy will be done."

2.
My Jesus, as thou wilt:
Tho' seen thro' many a tear,
Let not my star of hope
Grow dim or disappear.
Since thou on earth hast wept
And sorrowed oft alone,
If I must weep with thee,
"My Lord, thy will be done."

3.
My Jesus, as thou wilt:
All shall be well for me;
Each changing future scene
I gladly trust with thee.
Straight to my home above,
I travel calmly on,
And sing in life or death,
"My Lord, thy will be done."
