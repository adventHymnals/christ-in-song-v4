#### Advent Hymnals
## 658. FORWARD!  OUR WATCHWORD
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Forward!  be our watchword,
Steps and voices joined;
Seek the things before us,
Not a look behind;
Burns the fiery pillar, 
At our army's head,
Who shall dream of shrinking,
By our Captain led?

Refrain:
Forward!  in the conflict,
Thro' the toil and fight,
Foes must fall before us,
God will speed the right.

2.
Forward out of error,
Leave behind the night;
Forward thro' the darkness,
Forward into light!
Glories upon glories
Hath our God prepared,
By the souls that love Him
One day to be shared!  [Refrain]

3.
Far o'er yon horizon
Rise the city towers,
Where our God abideth;
That fair home is ours!
Thither, onward thither,
In the Spirit's might,
Lovers of your country,
Forward into light!  [Refrain]
