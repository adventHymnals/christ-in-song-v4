## 652. PILOT ME
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me
Over life's tempestuous sea;
Unknown waves before me roll,
Hiding rock and treach'rous shoal;
Chart and compass came from thee;
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me.

2.
As a mother stills her child,
Thou canst calm the ocean wild;
Boist'rous waves obey thy will
When thou say'st to them, "Be still!"
Wond'rous Sov'reign of the sea,
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me.

3.
When at last I near the shore,
And the fearful breakers roar
'Tween me and the peaceful rest,
Then, while leaning on thy breast,
May I hear thee say to me,
"Fear not, I will pilot thee."
