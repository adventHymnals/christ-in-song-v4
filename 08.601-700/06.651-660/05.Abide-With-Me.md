## 655. ABIDE WITH ME
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Abide with me!  Fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O, abide with me!

2.
Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O thou who changest not, abide with me!

3.
Not a brief glance I ask, nor passing word,
But as thou dwell'st with thy disciples, Lord,
Familiar, condescending, patient, free,
Come, not to sojourn, but abide with me!

4.
I need thy presence ev'ry passing hour;
What but thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r.
Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Thro' cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me!

5.
I fear no foe, with thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;
Where is death's sting?  where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if thou abide with me.
