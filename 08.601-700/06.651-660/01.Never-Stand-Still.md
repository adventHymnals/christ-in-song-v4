## 651. NEVER STAND STILL
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Come, let us anew our journey pursue,
Roll round with the year,
And never stand still till the Master appear,
And never stand still till the Master appear.

2.
His adorable will let us gladly fulfill,
And our talents improve,
By the patience of hope and the labor or love,
By the patience of hope and the labor of love.

3.
Our life as a dream, our time as a stream,
Glides swiftly away,
And the fugitive moment refuses to stay,
And the fugitive moment refuses to stay.

4.
O, that each in the day of His coming may say,
"I have fought my way thro':
I have finished the work thou didst give me to do,
I have finished the work thou didst give me to do."

5.
O, that each from his Lord may receive the glad word,
"Well and faithfully done! 
Enter into my joy, and sit down on my throne,
Enter into my joy, and sit down on my throne."
