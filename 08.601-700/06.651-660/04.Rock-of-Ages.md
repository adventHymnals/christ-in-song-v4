####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Rock of Ages, cleft for me!
Let me hide myself in thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From thy riven side that flowed,
Be of sin the double cure;
Save me from its guilt and pow'r.

2.
Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfil thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and thou alone.

3.
Nothing in my hand I bring
Simply to thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to thee for dress,
Helpless, look to thee for grace;
Foul, I to the Fountain fly,
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.

4.
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyes shall close in death,
When I soar to world's unknown,
See thee on thy Judgment throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in thee.
