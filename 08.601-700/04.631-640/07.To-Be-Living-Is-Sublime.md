## 637. TO BE LIVING IS SUBLIME
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
We are living, we are dwelling,
In a grand and awful time,
In an age on ages telling,
To be living is sublime.
Hark!  the waking up of nations,
Gog and Magog to the fray;
Hark!  what soundeth?  Is creation
Groaning for her latter day?

2.
Christian, rouse and arm for conflict,
Nerve thee for the battle field;
Bear the helmet of salvation,
And the mighty gospel shield;
Bind the breastplate firmly on thee,
Take the Spirit's sword in hand;
Boldly, fearlessly, go forth then,
In Jehovah's strength to stand.

3.
Wicked spirits gather round thee,
Legions of those foes to God--
Principalities most mighty--
Walk unseen the earth abroad;
They are gath'ring to the battle,
Strengthen'd for the last deep strife;
Christian, arm!  be watchful, ready,
Struggle manfully for life.
