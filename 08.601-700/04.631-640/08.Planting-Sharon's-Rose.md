        Christ in Song 638. Planting Sharon's Rose. Lord, thou callest for the workers, Glad we come at thy command; Give us each the worker's outfit, Loving heart and ready hand. Great the honor, sweet the duty That thy love on us bestows, In the soul, howe'er unfertile, Planting Sharon's fadeless Rose!

## 638. PLANTING SHARON'S ROSE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Lord, thou callest for the workers,
Glad we come at thy command;
Give us each the worker's outfit,
Loving heart and ready hand.
Great the honor, sweet the duty
That thy love on us bestows,
In the soul, howe'er unfertile,
Planting Sharon's fadeless Rose!

2.
Bless our labors, God of heaven,
Aid thy servants, Lord of earth,
As we strive to set our garden
With the plant of priceless worth!
Patient all the day we labor,
Still at night the tempter sows
Tares of sin where we had planted
Sharon's fair and fadeless Rose!

3.
Ours is toil that knows no season;
Day and night to us are one;
Winter is the same as summer;
Ours is an eternal sun.
So when heat of summer scorches,
And when stormy winter blows.
Still we toil within our garden,
Planting Sharon's fadeless Rose!

4.
Wake, O North wind!  come, O South wind!
O'er our garden softly blow;
Bid the Rose's sacred perfume
From our tender plants to flow.
Come, Beloved, to thy garden;
All its sweets to thee it owes;
Shed thy holy fragrance o'er us,
Sharon's fair and fadeless Rose!
