        Christ in Song 636. The Watching Church. Lord, her watch Thy Church is keeping; When shall earth Thy rule obey? When shall end the night of weeping? When shall break the promised day? See the whit'ning harvest languish, Waiting still the lab'rers' toil; Was it vain, Thy Son's deep anguish! Shall the strong retain the spoil?

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Lord, her watch Thy Church is keeping;
When shall earth Thy rule obey?
When shall end the night of weeping?
When shall break the promised day?
See the whit'ning harvest languish,
Waiting still the lab'rers' toil;
Was it vain, Thy Son's deep anguish!
Shall the strong retain the spoil?

2.
Tidings, sent for ev'ry creature,
Millions yet have never heard;
Can they hear without a preacher?
Lord Almighty, give the word;
Give the word; in ev'ry nation
Let the gospel trumpet sound,
Witnessing of Thy salvation
To the earth's remotest bound.

3.
Then the end:  Thy Church completed,
All Thy chosen gathered in,
With their King in glory seated,
Satan bound, and banished sin;
Gone forever, parting, weeping,
Hunger, sorrow, death, and pain;
Lo!  her watch Thy church is keeping,
Come, Lord Jesus; come to reign.
