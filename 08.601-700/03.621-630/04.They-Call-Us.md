        Christ in Song 624. They Call Us. From Greenland's icy mountains, From India's coral strand, Where Afric's sunny fountains Roll down their golden sand, From many an ancient river, From many a palmy plain, They call us to deliver Their land from error's chain.

```txt
1.
From Greenland's icy mountains,
From India's coral strand,
Where Afric's sunny fountains
Roll down their golden sand,
From many an ancient river,
From many a palmy plain,
They call us to deliver
Their land from error's chain.

2.
What tho' the spicy breezes
Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle;
Tho' ev'ry prospect pleases,
And only man is vile;
In vain with lavish kindness
The gifts of God are strown;
The heathen in his blindness,
Bows down to wood and stone.  

3.
Shall we whose souls are lighted,
With wisdom from on high,
Shall we to men benighted,
The lamp of life deny?
Salvation, O salvation!
The joyful sound proclaim
Till earth's remotest nation
Has heard Messiah's name.

4.
Waft, waft, ye winds, His story,
Ye waters, onward roll,
Till, like a sea of glory,
It spreads from pole to pole;
Till o'er our ransomed nature
The Lamb for sinners slain
Redeemer, King, Creator--
In bliss returns to reign.
