## 621. MEN OF GOD, ARISE!
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The whole wide world is pleading:
Ye men of God arise!
His providence is leading
To many'a glad surprise,
Lo!  ev'ry sky is bright'ning,
Rich promise clothes the soil;
Wide fields for harvest whit'ning,
Invite the reaper's; toil.

2.
Go, where the waves are breaking
On coldest Northern shore,
The precious Gospel taking,
More rich than golden ore.
On highest Eastern mountain,
In lowest Western vale;
Beside the Southern fountains,
Rehearse the wondrous tale.

3.
The love of Christ unfolding,
Speed on from east to west,
Till all, by faith behold,
In Christ are fully blest.
Great Author of salvation,
Haste, haste the glorious day
Great Author of salvation,
Haste, haste the glorious day
Foretold by revelation,
Thy universal sway,
