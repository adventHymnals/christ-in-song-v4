## 625. I COULD NOT DO WITHOUT
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I could not do without Thee,
O Saviour of the lost,
Whose wondrous love redeemed me,
At such tremendous cost;
Thy righteousness, Thy pardon,
Thy precious blood must be
My only hope and comfort, 
My glory and my plea.

2.
I could not do without Thee,
I cannot stand alone,
I have no strength or goodness,
No wisdom of my own;
But Thou, beloved Saviour,
Art all in all to me,
And weakness will be power
If leaning hard on Thee.

3.
I could not do without Thee,
For, oh, the way is long,
And I am often weary,
And sigh replaces song:
How could I do without Thee?
I do not know the way;
Thou knowest, and Thou leadest,
And wilt not let me stray.

4.
I could not do without Thee,
For years are fleeting fast,
And soon in solemn silence,
The river must be passed;
But Thou wilt never leave me,
And tho' the waves roll high,
I know Thou wilt be near me,
And whisper "It is I."  Amen.
