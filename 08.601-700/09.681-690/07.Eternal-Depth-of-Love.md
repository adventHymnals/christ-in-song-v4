## 687. ETERNAL DEPTH OF LOVE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Eternal depth of love divine,
In Jesus, God with us, displayed,
How brightly thy beaming glories shine!
How wide thy healing streams are spread,
How wide thy healing streams are spread!

2.
With whom dost thou delight to dwell?
Sinner, a vile and thankless race!
O God, what tongue aright can tell
How vast thy love, how great thy grace?
How vast thy love, how great thy grace?

3.
The dictates of thy sov'reign will
With joy our grateful hearts receive;
All thy delight in us fulfill:
Lo, all we are, to thee we give;
Lo, all we are, to thee we give.

4.
To thy sure love, thy tender care,
Our flesh, soul, spirit, we resign;
O, fix thy sacred presence there,
And seal th' abode forever thine!
And seal th' abode forever thine!
