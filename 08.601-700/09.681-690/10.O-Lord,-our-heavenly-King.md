## 690. O LORD, OUR HEAVENLY KING
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O Lord, our heavenly King,
Thy name is all divine;
Thy glories round the earth are spread,
And o'er the heavens they shine.

2.
Lord, what is worthless man,
That thou shouldst love him so?
Next to thine angels he is placed,
And lord of all below.

3.
Now rich thy bounties are,
And wondrous are thy ways!
In us O let thy power frame
A monument of praise!
