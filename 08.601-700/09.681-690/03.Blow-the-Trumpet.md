####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Watchman, blow the gospel trumpet,
Ev'ry soul a warning give;
Whosoever hears the message
May repent, and turn, and live.

Chorus:
Blow the trumpet, trusty watchman,
Blow it loud o'er land and sea;
God commissions, sound the message!
Ev'ry captive may be free.

2.
Sound it loud o'er ev'ry hilltop,
Gloomy shade, and sunny plain;
Ocean depths repeat the message,
Full salvation's glad refrain.  [Chorus]

3.
Sound it in the hedge and highway,
Earth's dark spots where exiles roam;
Let it tell all things are ready,
Father waits to welcome home.  [Chorus]

4.
Sound it for the heavy laden,
Weary, longing to be free.
Sound a Saviour's invitation,
Sweetly saying, "Come to me."  [Chorus]
