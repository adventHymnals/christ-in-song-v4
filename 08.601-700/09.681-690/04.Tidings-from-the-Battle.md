####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Words of cheer from the battlefield of life,
Welcome tidings from the war;
Glorious news from the grand and holy strife,
Soon the conflict will be o'er.

Chorus:
Words of battle cheer!  tidings from the war!
"How has gone the conflict?"  Vict'ry's near;
Words of battle cheer!  tidings from the war!
Glorious news of vict'ry!  Words of cheer.

2.
Fierce and long has the struggle been with sin,
Still the Church moves on below;
War without and temptation from within,
Vainly seek her overthrow.  [Chorus]

3.
Stand like men!  there's a battle to be fought;
All the hosts of hell will rage;
Trust in God!  he deliverance has wrought
For his saints in ev'ry age.  [Chorus]

4.
Who so strong as to trust in self alone
'Gainst a foe so swift and sure?
Who so weak that he can not grasp the Throne
And the promised help secure?  [Chorus]
