        Christ in Song 686. We Lay Us Down to Sleep. We lay us calmly down to sleep When friendly night is come, and leave To God the rest; Whether we wake to smile or weep, Or wake no more on time's fair shore, He knoweth best, He knoweth best. O Father, us in safety keep! We lay us down to sleep.

## 686. WE LAY US DOWN TO SLEEP
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
We lay us calmly down to sleep
When friendly night is come, and leave
To God the rest;
Whether we wake to smile or weep,
Or wake no more on time's fair shore,
He knoweth best, He knoweth best.
O Father, us in safety keep!
We lay us down to sleep.

2.
As sinks the sun in western skies
When day is done, and twilight dim
Comes silent on,
So fades the world's most luring prize
On eyes that close in deep repose
Till wakes the dawn, Till wakes the dawn.
O Father, us in safety keep!
We lay us down to sleep.

3.
Why vex our souls with wearing care?
Why shun the grave, for aching head
So cool and low?
Have we found life so passing fair,
So grand to be, so sweet that we
Should dread to go?  Should dread to go?
O Father, us in safety keep!
We lay us down to sleep.

4.
Some other hand the task can take,
If so it seemeth best, the task
By us begun;
No work for which we need to wake
In joy or grief, for life so brief,
Beneath the sun, Beneath the sun.
O Father, us in safety keep!
We lay us down to sleep.
