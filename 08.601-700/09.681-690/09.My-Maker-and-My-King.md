####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
My Maker and my King,
To thee my all I owe;
Thy sov'reign bounty is the spring
Whence all my blessings flow;
Thy sov'reign bounty is the spring
Whence all my blessings flow.

2.
The creature of thy hand,
On thee alone I live;
My God, thy benefits demand
More praise than I can give;
My God, thy benefits demand
More praise than I can give.

3.
Lord, what can I impart
When all is thine before?
Thy love demands a thankful heart;
The gift, alas!  how poor;
Thy love demands a thankful heart;
The gift, alas!  how poor.

4.
O!  let thy grace inspire
My soul with strength divine;
Let ev'ry word and each desire
And all my days be thine;
Let ev'ry word and each desire
And all my days be thine.
