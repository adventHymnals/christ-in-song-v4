####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Tho' faint, yet pursuing, we go on our way;
The Lord is our Leader, His word is our stay;
Tho' suff'ring and sorrow, and trial be near,
The Lord is our Refuge, and whom can we fear?
The Lord is our Refuge, and whom can we fear?

2.
He raiseth the fallen, He cheereth the faint;
The weak and afflicted, He hears their complaint;
The way may be weary, and thorny the road,
But how can we falter?  our help is in God!
But how can we falter?  our help is in God!

3.
And to His green pastures our footsteps He leads:
His flock in the desert how kindly He feeds!
The lambs in His bosom He tenderly bears,
And brings back the wand'rers all safe from the snares,
And brings back the wand'rers all safe from the snares.

4.
Tho' clouds may surround us, our God is our light;
Tho' foes would confound us, our God is our might;
So, faint yet pursuing, still onward we come;
The Lord is our Leader, and heaven our home!
The Lord is our Leader, and heaven our home!
