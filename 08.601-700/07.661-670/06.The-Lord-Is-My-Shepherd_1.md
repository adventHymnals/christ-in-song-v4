        Christ in Song 666. The Lord Is My Shepherd_1. The Lord is my Shepherd, no want shall I know, I feed in green pastures, safe folded I rest, He leadeth my soul where the still waters flow, Restores me when wand'ring, redeems when oppress'd, Restores me when wand'ring, redeems when oppress'd.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The Lord is my Shepherd, no want shall I know,
I feed in green pastures, safe folded I rest,
He leadeth my soul where the still waters flow,
Restores me when wand'ring, redeems when oppress'd,
Restores me when wand'ring, redeems when oppress'd.

2.
Thro the valley and shadow of death tho' I stray,
Since Thou art my Guardian, no evil I fear;
Thy rod shall deend me, Thy staff be my stay;
No harm can befall, with my Comforter near,
No harm can befall, with my Comforter near.

3.
In the midst of affliction my table is spread;
With blessings unmeasured my cup runneth o'er;
With perfume and oil Thou anointest my head;
Oh, what shall I ask of Thy providence more?
Oh, what shall I ask of Thy providence more?

4.
Let goodness and mercy, my bountiful God,
Still follow my steps till I meet Thee above,
I seek by the path which my forefather trod,
Thro' the land of their sojourn, Thy kingdom of love,
Thro' the land of their sojourn, Thy kingdom of love.
