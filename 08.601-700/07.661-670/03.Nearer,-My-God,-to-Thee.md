## 663. NEARER, MY GOD, TO THEE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!
E'en tho' it be a cross
That raiseth me!
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee, 
Nearer to thee.

2.
Tho' like a wanderer,
Daylight all gone,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone;
Yet in my dreams I'd be
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee.

3.
There let the way appear,
Steps up to heav'n,
All that thou sendest me,
In mercy giv'n;
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee.

4.
Then, with my waking tho'ts
Bright with thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I'll raise;
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee.

5.
Or if, on joyful wing
Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upward I fly,
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Near to thee.
