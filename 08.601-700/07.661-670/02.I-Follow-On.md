#### Advent Hymnals
## 662. I FOLLOW ON
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Saviour!  I follow on,
Guided by thee,
Seeing not yet the hand
That leadeth me;
Hushed be my heart, and still,
Fear I no further ill;
Only to meet thy will
My will shall be.

2.
Riven the Rock for me,
Thirst to relieve,
Manna from heaven falls
Fresh ev'ry eve;
Never a want severe
Causeth mine eye a tear,
But thou dost whisper near,
"Only believe!"

3.
Often to Marah's brink
Have I been bro't;
Shrinking the cup to drink,
Help I have sought;
And with the prayer's ascent,
Jesus the branch hath rent
Quickly relief hath sent,
Sweet'ning the draught.

4.
Saviour!  I long to walk
Closer with thee;
Led by thy guiding hand,
Ever to be
Constantly near thy side,
Quickened and purified,
Living for him who died
Freely for me.
