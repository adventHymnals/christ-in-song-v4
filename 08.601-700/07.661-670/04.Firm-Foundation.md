## 664. FIRM FOUNDATION
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord
Is laid for your faith in his excellent word!
What more can he say than to you he hath said
Who unto the Saviour for refuge have fled,
Who unto the Saviour for refuge have fled?

2.
"When thro' the deep waters I call thee to go,
The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;
For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress,
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress."

3.
"When thro' fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace all-sufficient shall be thy supply;
The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine,
Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine."

4.
"The soul that on Jesus doth lean for repose,
I will not, I will not, desert to his foes;
That soul, tho' all hell should endeavor to shake,
I'll never, no never, no never forsake,
I'll never, no never, no never forsake."
