        Christ in Song 661. Not My Way. Thy way, not mine, O Lord, However dark it be; Lead me by thine own hand, And choose the path for me. I dare not choose my lot; I would not if I might; Choose thou for me, my God,  So shall I walk aright.

## 661. NOT MY WAY
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Thy way, not mine, O Lord,
However dark it be;
Lead me by thine own hand,
And choose the path for me.
I dare not choose my lot;
I would not if I might;
Choose thou for me, my God, 
So shall I walk aright.

2.
The kingdom that I seek
Is thine; so let the way
That leads to it be thine,
Else I must surely stray.
Hold thou my cup of life;
With joy or sorrow fill
As best to thee may seem:
Choose thou my good and ill.

3.
Choose thou for me my friends,
My sickness or my health;
Choose thou my cares for me,
My poverty or wealth.
Not mine, not mine the choice,
In either great or small;
Be thou my Guide, my Strength, 
My Wisdom, and my All.

```
