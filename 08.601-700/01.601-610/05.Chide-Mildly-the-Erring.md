#### Advent Hymnals
## 605. CHIDE MILDLY THE ERRING
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Chide mildly the erring,
Kind language endears,
Grief follows the sinful,
Add not to their tears;
Avoid with reproaches
Fresh pain to bestow;
The heart that is stricken
Needs never a blow.

2.
Chide mildly the erring,
Jeer not at their fall;
If strength be but human,
How feeble were all!
What marvel that footsteps
Should wander away,
When tempests so darken
Life's wearisome way?

3.
Chide mildly the erring,
Entreat them with care;
Their natures are mortal,
They need not despair.
We all have some frailty,
We all are unwise;
The grace which redeems us
Must come from the skies.

```
