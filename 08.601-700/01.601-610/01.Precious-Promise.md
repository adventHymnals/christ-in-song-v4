####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Precious promise God hath given
To the weary passer by,
On the way from earth to heaven,
"I will guide thee with mine eye."

Chorus:
I will guide thee,
I will guide thee,
I will guide thee with mine eye;
On the road from earth to heaven,
I will guide thee with mine eye.

2.
When temptations almost win thee,
And thy trusted watchers fly,
Let this promise ring within thee,
"I will guide thee with mine eye."  [Chorus]

3.
When they secret hopes have perished
In the grave of years gone by,
Let this promise still be cherished,
"I will guide thee with mine eye."  [Chorus]

4.
When the shades of life are falling,
And the hour has come to die,
Hear the trusty Pilot calling,
"I will guide thee with mine eye."  [Chorus]
