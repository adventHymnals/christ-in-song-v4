####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I need Thee every hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.

Refrain:
I need Thee, O I need Thee!
Every hour I need Thee;
O bless me now, my Saviour!
I come to Thee.

2.
I need Thee every hour;
Stay Thou near by;
Temptations lose their pow'r
When Thou art nigh.  [Refrain]

3.
I need Thee every hour,
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.  [Refrain]

4.
I need Thee every hour;
Teach me Thy will,
And Thy rich promises
In me fulfil.  [Refrain]

5.
I need Thee every hour,
Most Holy One;
O make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son.  [Refrain]
