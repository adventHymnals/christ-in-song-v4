####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
What a friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Ev'rything to God in pray'r!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Ev'rything to God in pray'r!

2.
Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in pray'r.
Can we find a friend so faithful,
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness;
Take it to the Lord in pray'r.

3.
Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in pray'r;
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in pray'r;
In his arms he'll take and shield thee;
Thou wilt find a solace there.
