####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I love thee, I love thee, I love thee, my Lord;
I love thee my Saviour, I love thee, my God.
I love thee, I love thee, and that thou dost know;
But how much I love then my actions will show.

2.
I'm happy, I'm happy, O, wondrous account!
My joys are immortal, I stand on the mount!
I gaze on my treasure and long to be there,
With Jesus and angels, and kindred so dear.

3.
O Jesus, my Saviour, with thee I am blest,
My life and salvation, my joy and my rest.
Thy love be my story, thy name be my song;
Thy grace shall inspire both my heart and my tongue.

4.
O, who's like my Saviour?  he's Salem's bright King;
He smiles, and he loves me, and helps me to sing.
I'll praise him, I'll praise him with notes loud and clear,
While rivers of pleasure my spirit do cheer.
