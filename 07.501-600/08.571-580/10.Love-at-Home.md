        Christ in Song 580. Love at Home. There is beauty all around, When there's love at home; There is joy in ev'ry sound, When there's love at home. Peace and plenty here abide, Smiling fair on ev'ry side; Time doth softly, sweetly glide, When there's love at home. Chorus: Love at home, love at home; Time doth softly, sweetly glide, When there's love at home.

```txt
1.
There is beauty all around,
When there's love at home;
There is joy in ev'ry sound,
When there's love at home.
Peace and plenty here abide,
Smiling fair on ev'ry side;
Time doth softly, sweetly glide,
When there's love at home.

Chorus:
Love at home, love at home;
Time doth softly, sweetly glide,
When there's love at home.

2.
In the cottage there is joy,
When there's love at home;
Hate and envy ne'er annoy,
When there's love at home.
Roses blossom 'neath our feet,
All the earth's a garden sweet,
Making life a bliss complete,
When there's love at home;  [Chorus]

3.
Kindly heaven smiles above,
When there's love at home;
All the earth is fill'd with love,
When there's love at home.
Sweeter sings the brooklet by,
Brighter beams azure sky;
O, there's One who smiles on high
When there's love at home.  [Chorus]

4.
Jesus, make me wholly thine,
Then there's love at home;
May thy sacrifice be mine,
Then there's love at home.
Safely from all harm I'll rest,
With no sinful care distress'd,
Thro' thy tender mercy blessed,
When there's love at home.  [Chorus]
