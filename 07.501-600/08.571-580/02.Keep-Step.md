        Christ in Song 572. Keep Step. In the struggle of life there's a conquest to win; Would you break from the fetters that bind you to sin? Would you vanquish the foe to the cause of the Right? You must gird on your armor bright. Persevere in all you do; Looking up, your way pursue; Toiling on till life is over, With the faithful gone before.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
In the struggle of life there's a conquest to win;
Would you break from the fetters that bind you to sin?
Would you vanquish the foe to the cause of the Right?
You must gird on your armor bright.
Persevere in all you do;
Looking up, your way pursue;
Toiling on till life is over,
With the faithful gone before.

Refrain:
Keep step!  step!  ever,
Keep step, keep step forever,
And the blessing of God will be yours to the end.
He will leave his children never.

2.
Would you cast in your lot with the people of God,
Would you follow the path which the righteous have trod?
You must ever be fervent and watch unto pray'r,
And the cross daily learn to bear.
Live for Christ, yourselves deny,
Seek your treasures in the sky;
Marching on till life is over,
With the faithful gone before.  [Refrain]

3.
Would you strive for the prize at the end of the race?
You must go to the Lord for his wisdom and grace;
Unto him that o'ercometh, the promise is giv'n
Of a home and a crown in heav'n
Would you dwell forever there?
On the Saviour cast your care;
Pressing on till life is over,
With the faithful gone before.  [Refrain]
