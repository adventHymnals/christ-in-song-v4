```txt
1.
Hear the pennies dropping!
Listen while they fall;
Ev'ry one for Jesus,
He will get them all,

Refrain:
Dropping, dropping, dropping, dropping;
Hear the pennies fall!
Ev'ry one for Jesus,
He will get them all.

2.
Dropping, dropping ever.
From each little hand;
'Tis our gift to Jesus,
From his little band.  [Refrain]

3.
Now, while we are little.
Pennies are are store;
But, when we are older,
Lord, we'll give thee more.  [Refrain]

4.
Tho, we've little money.
We can give him love;
He will own our off'ring,
Smiling from above.  [Refrain]
