1.
In the highways and hedges go seek for the lost,
Gather them in to the fold,
Was the earnest command that our Saviour divine
Taught his disciples of old.

Chorus:
Urge them to come, show them the way;
Tenderly, lovingly, bring them today;
Urge them to come, why should they roam?
Bring them along to our dear Saviour's home.

2.
If the Shepherd we love, we will care for the sheep;
Precious are they in his sight;
They are out in the desert, they wander alone;
Lead them from darkness to light.  [Chorus]

3.
To the weary and thirsty the Saviour has said,
"Come, heavy laden, to me,
I will give you to drink of the water of life;"
Tell them the fountain is free.  [Chorus]

4.
There's welcome for all in the kingdom of grace,
All who repent and believe;
And the souls that have stray'd and returned to the fold,
Jesus will gladly receive.  [Chorus]
