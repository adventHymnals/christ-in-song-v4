Winning precious souls to Thee;

Winning precious souls, many precious souls,
Jewels in Thy crown to be;
Help us bring them in from the ways of sin,
Many precious souls to Thee.

Winning precious souls to Thee;
And gather many sheaves for Thee,
Winning precious souls to Thee.  [Chorus]

We toil with feeble hands and weak,
Winning precious souls to thee;
To us new faith and courage speak,
Winning precious souls to thee.  [Chorus]

Our faith increase, our zeal renew,
Winning precious souls to Thee.  [Chorus]

Winning precious souls to Thee.  [Chorus]
