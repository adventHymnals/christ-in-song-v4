#### Advent Hymnals
## 539. JUST A RAY OF SUNSHINE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Just a ray of sunshine
Breaking thro' the gloom,
Makes the earth rejoice again,
And the flow'rs to bloom:
Makes the earth rejoice again
And makes the flow'rs to bloom.

2.
Just a little kindness,
Bright and sunny smile,
Makes the sad heart sing again,
All its cares beguile,
Makes the sad heart sing again
And all its cares beguile.

3.
Words and smiles so kindly
Like the sunshine fall,
Let your presence ever be
Blessings unto all;
Let your presence ever be
Rich blessings unto all.

```
