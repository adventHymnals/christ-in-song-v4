####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Closer to thee, my Father, draw me,
I long for thine embrace;
Closer within thine arms enfold me,
I seek a resting place.

Chorus:
Closer with the cords of love,
Draw me to thyself above;
Closer draw me, 
To thyself above.

2.
Closer to thee, my Saviour, draw me,
Nor let me leave thee more;
Fain would I feel thine arms around me,
And count my wand'rings o'er.  [Chorus]

3.
Closer by thy sweet Spirit draw me,
Till I am all like thee;
Quicken, refine, and wash and cleanse me,
Till I am pure and free.  [Chorus]
