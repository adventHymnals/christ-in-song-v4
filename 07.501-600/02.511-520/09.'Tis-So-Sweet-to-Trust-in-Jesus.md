####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to take Him at His word;
Just to rest upon His promise;
Just to know, "Thus saith the Lord."

Refrain:
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him;
How I've prov'd Him o'er and o'er!
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O for grace to trust Him more!

2.
O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust His cleansing blood;
Just in simple faith to plunge me
'Neath the healing, cleansing flood.  [Refrain]

3.
Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just from sin and self to cease;
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life, and rest, and joy, and peace.  [Refrain]

4.
I'm so glad I learn'd to trust Thee,
Precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend;
And I know that Thou art with me,
Wilt be with me till the end.  [Refrain]
