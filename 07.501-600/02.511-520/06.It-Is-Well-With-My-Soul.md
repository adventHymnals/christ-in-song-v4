        Christ in Song 516. It Is Well With My Soul. When peace like a river attendeth my way, When sorrows like sea billows roll; Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say, "It is well, it is well with my soul."

## 516. IT IS WELL WITH MY SOUL
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
When peace like a river attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
"It is well, it is well with my soul."

Refrain:
It is well
with my soul,
It is well,
it is well with my soul.

2.
Tho' Satan should buffet, tho' trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed his own blood for my soul.  [Refrain]

3.
My sin O the bliss of the glorious tho't!
My sin, not in part, but the whole,
Is nailed to his cross and I bear it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!  [Refrain]

4.
And, Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend;
"Even so" it is well with my soul.  [Refrain]
