Are you weary, are you heavy hearted?
Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus,
Are you grieving over joys departed?
Tell it to Jesus alone.

Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus,
He is a friend that's well known;
You've no other such a friend or brother,
Tell it to Jesus alone.

2.
Do the tears flow down your checks unbidden?
Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus;
Have you sins that to the world are hidden?
Tell it to Jesus alone.  [Chorus]

3.
Do you fear the gath'ring clouds of sorrow?
Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus;
Are you anxious what shall be tomorrow?  Tell it to Jesus alone.  [Chorus]

Are you troubled at the tho't of dying?
Tell it to Jesus, Tell is to Jesus;
For Christ's coming kingdom are you sighing?
Tell it to Jesus alone.  [Chorus]
