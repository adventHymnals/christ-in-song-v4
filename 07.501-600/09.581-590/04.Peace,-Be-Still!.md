        Christ in Song 584. Peace, Be Still!. Master, the tempest is raging! The billows are tossing high! The sky is o'ershadow'd with blackness; No shelter or help is nigh; "Carest thou not that we perish? How canst thou lie asleep, When each moment so madly is threat'ning A grave in the angry deep? Chorus: "The winds and the waves obey my will, Peace, be still! Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea, Or demons, or men, or whatever it be, No water can swallow the ship where lies The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies; They all sweetly obey my will; Peace, be still! Peace, be still! They all shall sweetly obey my will; Peace, peace, be still!

1.
Master, the tempest is raging!
The billows are tossing high!
The sky is o'ershadow'd with blackness;
No shelter or help is nigh;
"Carest thou not that we perish?
How canst thou lie asleep,
When each moment so madly is threat'ning
A grave in the angry deep?

Chorus:
"The winds and the waves obey my will,
Peace, be still!
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
Or demons, or men, or whatever it be,
No water can swallow the ship where lies
The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies;
They all sweetly obey my will;
Peace, be still!
Peace, be still!
They all shall sweetly obey my will;
Peace, peace, be still!

2.
Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in my grief today;
The depths of my sad heart are troubled;
O waken and save, I pray!
Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep o'er my sinking soul;
And I perish, I perish!  dear Master;
O hasten and take control.  [Chorus]

3.
Master, the terror is over,
The elements sweetly rest;
Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,
And heaven's within my breast;
Linger, O blessed Redeemer,
Leave me alone no more;
And with joy I shall make the blest harbor,
And rest on the blissful shore.  [Chorus]
