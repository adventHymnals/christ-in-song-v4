        Christ in Song 581. Angry Words!  Oh, Let Them Never. Angry words!  oh, let them never From the tongue unbridled slip; May the heart's best impulse ever Check them e'er they soil the lip. Chorus: "Love one another," Thus saith the Saviour, Children, obey the Father's blest command: "Love one another," Thus saith the Saviour, Children, obey his blest command.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Angry words!  oh, let them never
From the tongue unbridled slip;
May the heart's best impulse ever
Check them e'er they soil the lip.

Chorus:
"Love one another," Thus saith the Saviour,
Children, obey the Father's blest command:
"Love one another," Thus saith the Saviour,
Children, obey his blest command.

2.
Love is much too pure and holy,
Friendship is too sacred far,
For a moment's reckless folly
Thus to desolate and mar.  [Chorus]

3.
Angry words are lightly spoken;
Bitt'rest tho'ts are rashly stirred
Brightest links of life are broken,
By a single angry word.  [Chorus]
