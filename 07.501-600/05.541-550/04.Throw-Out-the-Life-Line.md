Throw out the Life-Line across the dark wave, There is a brother whom some one shall save; Somebody's brother!  oh, who then, will dare To throw out the Life-Line his peril to share? Chorus: Throw out the Life-Line!  Throw out the Life-Line! Some one is drifting away;  Throw out the Life-Line!  Throw out the Life-Line! Some one is sinking today.

#### Advent Hymnals
## 544. THROW OUT THE LIFE-LINE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Throw out the Life-Line across the dark wave,
There is a brother whom some one shall save;
Somebody's brother!  oh, who then, will dare
To throw out the Life-Line his peril to share?

Chorus:
Throw out the Life-Line!  Throw out the Life-Line!
Some one is drifting away; 
Throw out the Life-Line!  Throw out the Life-Line!
Some one is sinking today.

2.
Throw out the Life-Line, With hand quick and strong,
Why do you tarry, why linger so long?
See!  he is sinking; oh, hasten today
And out with the Life-Boat!  away, then, away!  [Chorus]

3.
Throw out the Life-Line to danger-fraught men,
Sinking in anguish where you've never been:
Winds of temptation and billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow.  [Chorus]

4.
Soon will the season of rescue be o'er,
Soon will they drift to eternity's shore,
Haste, then, my brother, no time for delay,
But throw out the Life-Line and save them today.  [Chorus]

```
