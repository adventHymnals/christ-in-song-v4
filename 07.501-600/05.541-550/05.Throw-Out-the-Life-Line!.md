        Christ in Song 545. Throw Out the Life-Line!. Out upon an angry ocean, Without helm or oar, Millions in the wild commotion, Sink to rise no more. Chorus: Throw out the life-line!  Throw out the life-line! Night is swiftly coming; Behold the setting sun! Throw out the life-line!  throw out the life-line! Jesus is the life-line; You may save one.

#### Advent Hymnals
## 545. THROW OUT THE LIFE-LINE!
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Out upon an angry ocean,
Without helm or oar,
Millions in the wild commotion,
Sink to rise no more.

Chorus:
Throw out the life-line!  Throw out the life-line!
Night is swiftly coming; Behold the setting sun!
Throw out the life-line!  throw out the life-line!
Jesus is the life-line; You may save one.

2.
On a flow'ry gospel meadow,
Thousands dwell at ease,
Caring not that Death's dark shadow
Haunts the stormy seas.  [Chorus]

3.
How can we who once were rescued
At so great a cost,
Cast adrift the only Life-Line,
Laughing at the lost!  [Chorus]

4.
Brothers, hear your brothers calling,
"Throw the line this way;"
Sisters, see your sisters sinking,
With no arm to stay.  [Chorus]

```
