        Christ in Song 547. The Call for Reapers. Far and near the fields are teeming With the sheaves of ripened grain; Far and near their gold is gleaming O'er the sunny slope and plain. Chorus: Lord of harvest, send forth reapers! Hear us, Lord, to thee we cry; Send them now the sheaves to gather, Ere the harvest time pass by.

```txt
1.
Far and near the fields are teeming
With the sheaves of ripened grain;
Far and near their gold is gleaming
O'er the sunny slope and plain.

Chorus:
Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!
Hear us, Lord, to thee we cry;
Send them now the sheaves to gather,
Ere the harvest time pass by.

2.
Send them forth with morn's first beaming,
Send them in the noontide's glare;
When the sun's last rays are streaming,
Bid them gather ev'rywhere.  [Chorus]

3.
O thou whom thy Lord is sending,
Gather now the sheaves of gold,
Heav'nward then at evening wending
Thou shalt come with joy untold.  [Chorus]
