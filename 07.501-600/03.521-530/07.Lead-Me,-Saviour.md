1.
Saviour, lead me lest I stray,
Gently lead me all the way;
I am safe when by thy side,
I would in thy love abide.
Lead me, Lead me, 
Saviour, lead me, lest I stray;
Gently down the stream of time,
Lead me, Saviour, all the way.

2.
Thou the refuge of my soul,
When life's stormy billows roll;
I am safe when thou art nigh,
All my hopes on thee rely.
Lead me, Lead me, 
Saviour, lead me, lest I stray;
Gently down the stream of time,
Lead me, Saviour, all the way.

3.
Saviour, lead me till at last,
When the storm of life is past,
I shall reach the land of day,
Where all tears are wiped away.
Lead me, Lead me, 
Saviour, lead me, lest I stray;
Gently down the stream of time,
Lead me, Saviour, all the way.
