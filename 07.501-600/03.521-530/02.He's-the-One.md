        Christ in Song 522. He's the One. Is there anyone can help us, one who understands our hearts When the thorns of life have pierced them till they bleed; One who sympathizes with us, who in wondrous love imparts Just the very, very blessing that we need? Chorus: Yes, there's One, only One, The blessed, blessed Jesus, He's the One; When afflictions press the soul, when waves of trouble roll, And you need a friend to help you, He's the One.

1.
Is there anyone can help us, one who understands our hearts
When the thorns of life have pierced them till they bleed;
One who sympathizes with us, who in wondrous love imparts
Just the very, very blessing that we need?

Chorus:
Yes, there's One, only One,
The blessed, blessed Jesus, He's the One;
When afflictions press the soul, when waves of trouble roll,
And you need a friend to help you, He's the One.

2.
Is there anyone can help us when the load is hard to bear,
And we faint and fall beneath it in alarm;
Who in tenderness will lift us, and the heavy burden share,
And support us with an everlasting arm?  [Chorus]

3.
Is there anyone can help us, who can give a sinner peace
When His heart is burden'd down with pain and woe;
Who can speak the word of pardon that affords sweet release,
And whose blood can wash and makes as white as snow?  [Chorus]
