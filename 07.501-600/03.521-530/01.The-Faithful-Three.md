####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Look upon the golden image,
Hear the king's decree,
See the burning fiery furnace,
And the faithful three.

Chorus:
Stand for the right
Wherever you may be,
Trust in the Lord,
Like the faithful three.
We will follow their example,
Brave and faithful three,
Bowing not before the image
At the world's decree.

2.
'Twas a heathen king's commandment
Governed conscience then,
Yet how bravely for Jehovah
Stood those noble men!  [Chorus]

3.
So when earthly creeds of error
Bid you bend the knee,
Turn and read the simple story
Of the faithful three.  [Chorus]

4.
God is able to deliver
As in days of old,
All who walk the path of duty,
Fearless, firm, and bold.  [Chorus]
