```txt
1.
Father, we come to thee,
No other help have we,
Thou wilt our refuge be,
On thee we call;
Earth is but dark and drear
Without thy presence near;
Be thou our comfort here,
Father of all.

Chorus:
Father, we come to thee,
Turn not away;
Helpless we come to thee,
Hear while we pray.

2.
Save from our many foes,
Save from our earthly woes,
Be thou our soul's repose
In time of need;
Fearful are we and weak,
To us sweet courage speak;
Thy mighty arm we seek
For strength indeed.  [Chorus]

3.
Give us by grace divine,
Seal us forever thine,
Our wayward feet incline
From sin to flee.
O guide us we implore,
'Till weary life is o'er,
And on a brighter shore 
We dwell with thee.  [Chorus]
