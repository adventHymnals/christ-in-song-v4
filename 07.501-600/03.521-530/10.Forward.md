```txt
1.
Christ, our mighty Captain, leads against the foe;
We will never falter when He bids us go;
Tho' His righteous purpose we may never know,
Yet we'll follow all the way.

Chorus:
Forward!  forward! 'tis the Lord's command.
Forward!  forward to the promised land;
Forward!  forward!  let the chorus ring;
We are sure to win with Christ our King!

2.
Let our glorious banner ever be unfurled;
From its mighty stronghold evil shall be hurled;
Christ, our mighty Captain, overcomes the world,
And we follow all the way.  [Chorus]

3.
Fierce the battle rages, but 'twill not be long,
Then triumphant shall we join the blessed throng,
Joyfully uniting in the victor's song,
If we follow all the way.  [Chorus]
