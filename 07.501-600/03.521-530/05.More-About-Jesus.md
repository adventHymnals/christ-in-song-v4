## 525. MORE ABOUT JESUS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
More about Jesus I would know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me.

Refrain:
More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me.

2.
More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God, my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.  [Refrain]

3.
More about Jesus; in His word
Holding communion with my Lord,
Hearing His voice in ev'ry line,
Making each faithful saying mine.  [Refrain]

4.
More about Jesus; on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdom's sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace.  [Refrain]
