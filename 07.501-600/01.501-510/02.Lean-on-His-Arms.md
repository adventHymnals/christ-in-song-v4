1.
Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
He'll help you along, help you along;
If you will trust His love unfailing,
He'll fill your heart with song.

Chorus:
Lean on His arms, trusting in His love;
Lean on His arms, all His mercies prove;
Lean on His arms, looking home above,
Just lean on the Saviour's arms!

2.
Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
He'll brighten the way, brighten the way;
Just follow gladly where He leadeth,
His gentle voice obey.  [Chorus]

3.
Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
O bring ev'ry care, bring ev'ry care!
The burden that has seemed so heavy,
Take it to the Lord in pray'r.  [Chorus]

4.
Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
Then leave all to Him, leave all to Him;
His heart is full of love and mercy,
His eyes are never dim.  [Chorus]
