## 501. LIKE A LITTLE CANDLE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Jesus bids us shine with a pure, clear light,
Like a little candle burning in the night;
In this world of darkness we must shine,
You in your corner, I in mine.

2.
Jesus bids us shine thro' the gloom around,
Many kinds of darkness in this world are found;
Sin, and want, and sorrow; so we shine,
You in your corner, I in mine.

3.
When we shine for others we shine for Him,
Well He sees and knows it if our light is dim;
He looks down from heaven, sees us shine,
You in your corner, I in mine.

4.
Jesus is a bright light of love divine,
When on Him we're looking, then it is we shine,
Like the silver moon, with borrowed light,
Each in his corner, doing right.

```
