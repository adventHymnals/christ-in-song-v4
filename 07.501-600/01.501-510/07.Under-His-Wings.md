        Christ in Song 507. Under His Wings. Under His wings I am safely abiding; Tho' the night deepens and tempests are wild, Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me; He has redeemed me, and I am His child. Chorus: Under His wings, under His wings, Who from His love can sever? Under His wings my soul shall abide, Safely abide forever.

```txt
1.
Under His wings I am safely abiding;
Tho' the night deepens and tempests are wild,
Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;
He has redeemed me, and I am His child.

Chorus:
Under His wings, under His wings,
Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings my soul shall abide,
Safely abide forever.

2.
Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!
How the heart yearningly turns to its rest!
Often when earth has no balm for my healing,
There I find comfort, and there I am blest.  [Chorus]

3.
Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment!
There will I hide till life's trials are o'er;
Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;
Resting in Jesus I'm safe ever more.  [Chorus]
