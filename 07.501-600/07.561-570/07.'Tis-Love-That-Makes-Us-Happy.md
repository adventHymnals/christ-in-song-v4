####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
'Tis love that makes us happy,
'Tis love that smooths the way;
It helps us "mind," it makes us kind
To others ev'ry day.

Refrain:
God is love; we're his little children.
God is love; we would be like him.
'Tis love that makes us happy,
'Tis love that smooths the way;
It helps us "mind," it makes us kind
To others ev'ry day.

2.
This world is full of sorrow,
Of sickness, death, and sin;
With loving heart we'll do our part,
And try some soul to win.  [Refrain]

3.
And when this life is over,
And we are called above,
Our song shall be, eternally,
Of Jesus and his love.  [Refrain]
