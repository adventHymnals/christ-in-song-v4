```txt
1.
Hark!  'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear,
Out in the desert dark and drear,
Calling the sheep who've gone astray,
Far from the Shepherd's fold away.

Chorus:
Bring them in,
Bring them in,
Bring them in from the fields of sin;
Bring them in,
Bring them in,
Bring the wanderers to Jesus.

2.
Who'll go and help the Shepherd kind,
Help Him the wand'ring ones to find?
Who'll bring them back into the fold,
Where they'll be sheltered from the cold?  [Chorus]

3.
Out in the desert hear their cry,
Out on the mountain wild and high.
Hark!  'tis the Master speaks to thee,
"Go, find my sheep where'er they be."  [Chorus]
