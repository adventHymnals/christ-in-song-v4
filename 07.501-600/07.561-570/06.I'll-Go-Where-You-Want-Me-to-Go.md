        Christ in Song 566. I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go. It may not be on the mountain's height, Nor over the stormy sea; It may not be at the battle's front My Lord will have need of me; But if by a still, small voice he calls To paths that I do not know, I'll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine, I'll go where you want me to go.

```txt
1.
It may not be on the mountain's height,
Nor over the stormy sea;
It may not be at the battle's front
My Lord will have need of me;
But if by a still, small voice he calls
To paths that I do not know,
I'll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine,
I'll go where you want me to go.

Refrain:
I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,
Over mountain, or plain, or sea;
I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord,
I'll be what you want me to be.

2.
Perhaps today there are loving words
Which Jesus would have me speak,
There may be now in the paths of sin
Some wand'rer when I should seek;
O Saviour, if thou wilt be my guide,
Tho' rugged and dark the way,
My voice shall echo thy message sweet,
I'll say what you want me to say.  [Refrain]

3.
There's surely somewhere a lowly place
In earth's harvest fields so wide,
Where I may labor thro' life's short day
For Jesus, the crucified;
So trusting my all to thy tender care,
And knowing thou lovest me,
I'll do thy will with a heart sincere,
I'll be what you want me to be.  [Refrain]
