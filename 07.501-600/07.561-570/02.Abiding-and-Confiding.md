        Christ in Song 562. Abiding and Confiding.

```txt
1.
I have learn'd the wondrous secret
Of abiding in the Lord;
I have found the strength and sweetness
Of confiding in his word;
I have tasted life's pure fountain,
I am trusting in his blood,
I have lost myself in Jesus,
I am sinking into God.

Chorus:
I'm abiding in the Lord,
And confiding in his word,
And I'm hiding, safely hiding, 
In the bosom of his love.

2.
I am crucified with Jesus,
And he lives and dwells in me,
I have ceased from all my struggling,
'Tis no longer I, but he;
All my will is yielded to him,
And his Spirit reigns within,
And his precious blood each moment
Keeps me cleans'd and free from sin.  [Chorus]

3.
All my cares I cast upon him,
And he bears them all away;
All my fears and griefs I tell him,
All my needs from day to day.
All my strength I draw from Jesus,
By his breath I live and move;
E'en his very mind he gives me,
And his faith, and life, and love.  [Chorus]

4.
For my words I take his wisdom,
For my works his Spirit's pow'r,
For my ways his gracious Presence 
Guards and guides me ev'ry hour.
Of my heart he is the Portion,
Of my joy the ceaseless Spring;
Saviour, the Sanctifier, Keeper, 
Glorious Lord and coming King.  [Chorus]
