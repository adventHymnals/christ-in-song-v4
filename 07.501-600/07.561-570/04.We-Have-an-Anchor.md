####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Will your anchor hold in the storm of life,
When the clouds unfold their wings of strife?
When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,
Will your anchor drift, or firm remain?

Refrain:
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll;
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love.

2.
If 'tis safely moor'd, 'twill the storm withstand,
For 'tis well secured by the Saviour's hand;
And the cables, pass'd from his heart to thine,
Can defy the blast, thro' strength divine.  [Refrain]

3.
It will firmly hold in the straits of Fear,
When the breakers tell that the reef is near,
Tho' the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,
Not an angry wave shall our bark o'erflow.  [Refrain]

4.
It will surely hold in the floods of death,
When the waters cold chill our latest breath,
On the rising tide it can never fail,
While our hopes abide within the veil.  [Refrain]

5.
When our eyes behold, in the dawning light,
Shining gates of pearl, our harbor bright,
We shall anchor fast to the heav'nly shore,
With the storms all past forevermore.  [Refrain}
