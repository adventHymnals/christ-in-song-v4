1.
Lonely!  no, not lonely
While Jesus standeth by;
His presence always cheers me;
I know that he is nigh.
Friendless?  no, not friendless,
For Jesus is my Friend;
I change, but he remaineth,
The same unto the end.

Chorus:
No, never alone, no, never alone;
He has promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.
No, never alone, no, never alone;
He has promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

2.
Weary?  no, not weary
While leaning on his breast;
My soul hath full enjoyment,
In His eternal rest.
Helpless?  yes, so helpless;
But I am leaning hard
On the mighty arm of Jesus,
And he is keeping guard.  [Chorus]

3.
Waiting?  yes, I'm waiting;
He bids me watch and wait;
I only wonder often,
What makes my Lord so late.
Joyful?  yes, so joyful,
With joy too deep for words;
A precious, sure foundation,
The joy that is my Lord's.  [Chorus]
