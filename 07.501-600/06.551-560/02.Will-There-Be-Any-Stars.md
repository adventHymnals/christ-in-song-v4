```txt
1.
I am thinking today of that beautiful land,
I shall reach when the sun goeth down;
When thro' wonderful grace by my Saviour I stand,
Will there be any stars in my crown?

Chorus:
Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown,
When at evening the sun goeth down?
When I wake with the blest
In the mansions of rest,
Will there be any stars in my crown?

2.
In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray;
Let me watch as a winner of souls;
That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day,
When His praise like the sea billows rolls.  [Chorus]

3.
O what joy will it be when His face I behold,
Living gems at His feet to lay down;
It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold, 
Should there be any stars in my crown.  [Chorus]
