#### Advent Hymnals
## 553. ALL MY CLASS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
All my class!  not one forgotten
When before the Throne I kneel;
I would share the loving burden
That my Saviour's heart doth feel.

Refrain:
Ev'ry one, blessed tho't!
Not a single name forgot.
One left out, His joy would dim;
Ev'ry one is dear to Him.

2.
All my class!  if one be missing
In the glorious gath'ring day,
How shall I account to Jesus?
What shall I with weeping say?  [Refrain]

3.
Daily would I walk before them,
Sinless in God's holy sight,
Pleading till His Spirit draw them,
Ev'ry one to life and light.  [Refrain]

```
