####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
If any little word of mine
May make a dark life brighter,
If any little song of mine
May make a sad heart lighter.

Chorus:
God help me speak the helping word,
And sweeten it with singing.
And drop it in some lonely vale, 
To set the echoes ringing.

2.
If any little love of mine
May make a hard life sweeter,
If any little care of mine
May make a friend's the fleeter.  [Chorus]

3.
If any little lift of mine
May ease a toiler bending,
God give me love, and care, and strength,
We live for Him by lending.  [Chorus]

```
