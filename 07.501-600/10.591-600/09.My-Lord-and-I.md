## 599. MY LORD AND I
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I have a Friend so precious,
So very dear to me,
He loves me with such tender love,
He loves so faithfully;
I could not live apart from Him,
I love to feel Him nigh,
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.

2.
Sometimes I'm faint and weary,
He knows that I am weak.
And as He bids me lean on Him,
His help I gladly seek:
He leads me in the paths of light,
Beneath a sunny sky,
And so we walk together, 
My Lord and I.

3.
I tell Him all my sorrows,
I tell Him all my joys,
I tell Him all that pleases me,
I tell Him what annoys;
He tells me what I ought to do,
He tells how to try,
And so we talk together,
My Lord and I.

4.
He knows that I am longing
Some weary soul to win,
And so He bids me go and speak
The loving word for Him;
He bids me tell His wondrous love,
And why He came to die,
And so we work together,
My Lord and I.
