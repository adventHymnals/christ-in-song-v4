####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Blessed Lord, how much I need thee!
Weak and sinful, poor and blind;
Take my trembling hand and lead me,
Strength and sight in thee I find.

Refrain:
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Blessed Lord, how much I need thee!
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Saviour, keep me ev'ry hour.

2.
Clothe me with thy robe of meekness,
Stained with sin this robe of mine;
Teach me first to feel my weakness,
Then to plead for strength divine.  [Refrain]

3.
Safe am I if thou dost guide me;
Trusting self, how seen I fall!
Walk life's rugged way be side me,
Thou, my light, my life, my all.  [Refrain]

4.
Then what e'er the future bringeth,
Smiles of joy or tears of grief,
Still to thee my spirit clingeth,
Thou art still my soul's relief.  [Refrain]
