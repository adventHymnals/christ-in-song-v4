        Christ in Song 592. Sleeping on Guard. Out from the campfire's red glowing, Cheerfully shedding the light, Onto the pickets we're going, For the long watches of night; Let us be careful that slumber Press not our eyelids too hard, Surely not one of our number Must be found sleeping on guard. Chorus: Sleeping on guard, sleeping on guard; No!  Surely not one of our number Must be found sleeping on guard.

#### Advent Hymnals
## 592. SLEEPING ON GUARD
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Out from the campfire's red glowing,
Cheerfully shedding the light,
Onto the pickets we're going,
For the long watches of night;
Let us be careful that slumber
Press not our eyelids too hard,
Surely not one of our number
Must be found sleeping on guard.

Chorus:
Sleeping on guard, sleeping on guard;
No!  Surely not one of our number
Must be found sleeping on guard.

2.
Yonder Rum's camp lights are burning,
Hark is the revelry there!
Waiting the conflict's returning,
Scouts are abroad ev'rywhere;
We must be watchful and ready,
See ev'ry entrance is barred,
Keeping our heads cool and steady;
All is lost sleeping on guard.  [Chorus]

3.
Our aim is vigilance ever,
We can allow no defeat;
True hearted soldiers will never
Join in the coward's retreat;
Wary and watchful be keeping
Tho' the task be e'er so hard,
Knowing what dangers come creeping
When we are sleeping on guard.  [Chorus]
