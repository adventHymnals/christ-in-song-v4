####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Able to deliver!  sound it far and near;
Able to deliver whosoe'er will hear;
From the fiery furnace, from the sinner's doom,
Jesus will deliver whosoe'er will come.

Chorus:
Able to deliver,
Able now to save,
When you are, my brother,
Able to believe.

2.
Able to deliver!  can it really be?
Is there any power can deliver me?
Tell me, tell me truly, is the Christ once slain
Able to deliver me from Satan's chain?  [Chorus]

3.
Able to deliver!  courage, trembling one!
Are you serving Jesus?  he will save his own.
Fear not Satan's power, cling to Jesus' hand,
Cease your fear and doubting, boldly for him stand.  [Chorus]
