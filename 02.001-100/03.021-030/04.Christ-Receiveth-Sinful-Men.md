#### Advent Hymnals
## 024. CHRIST RECEIVETH SINFUL MEN
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Sin it o'er and o'er again,
Glorious message, clear and plain;
'Tis today the same as then,
Christ receiveth sinful men.

Chorus:
Wonderful word, O sweet refrain!
Christ receives sinful men
Message of mercy, clear and plain,
Christ receiveth sinful men.

2.
"Seek and find," and "look and live;" 
Grace is free!  proclaim to all
Who the heav'nly pathway leave,
All who linger, all who fall.  [Chorus]

3.
Years of sin condemn us not,
Pure before the law we stand;
Jesus' blood removes each spot,
Satisfies its full demand.  [Chorus]

4.
He will take the sinfulest,
Make the scarlet white and pure;
Come, and he will give you rest;
Trust his word, forever sure.  [Chorus]

5.
In Thy righteous robe to shine,
Lord, I come, and rest forgiv'n;
Self is love in love divine,
Death in life, and earth in heav'n.  [Chorus]
