        Christ in Song 029. Ring the Bells of Heaven. Ring the bells of heaven!  there is joy today, For a soul, returning from the wild; See!  the Father meets him out upon the way, Welcoming His weary, wand'ring child. Chorus: Glory!  glory!  how the angels sing; Glory!  glory!  how the loud harps ring; 'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea, Pealing forth the anthem of the free.

1.
Ring the bells of heaven!  there is joy today,
For a soul, returning from the wild;
See!  the Father meets him out upon the way,
Welcoming His weary, wand'ring child.

Chorus:
Glory!  glory!  how the angels sing;
Glory!  glory!  how the loud harps ring;
'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea,
Pealing forth the anthem of the free.

2.
Ring the bells of heaven!  there is joy today,
For the wanderer now is reconciled;
Yes, a soul is rescued from his sinful way,
And is born a new a ransomed child.  [Chorus]

3.
Ring the bells of heaven!  spread the feast today,
Angels, swell the glad triumphant strain.
Tell the joyful tidings!  bear it far away!
For a precious soul is born again.  [Chorus]
