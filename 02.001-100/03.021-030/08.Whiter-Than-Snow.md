        Christ in Song 028. Whiter Than Snow. Blessed be the Fountain of blood, To a world of sinners revealed; Blessed be the dear Son of God; Only by his stripes we are healed. Tho' I've wandered far from his fold, Bringing to my heart pain and woe, Wash me in the blood of the Lamb, And I shall be whiter than snow. Chorus: Whiter than the snow, Whiter than the snow, Wash me in the blood of the Lamb, And I shall be whiter than snow.

1.
Blessed be the Fountain of blood,
To a world of sinners revealed;
Blessed be the dear Son of God;
Only by his stripes we are healed.
Tho' I've wandered far from his fold,
Bringing to my heart pain and woe,
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Chorus:
Whiter than the snow,
Whiter than the snow,
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

2.
Thorny was the crown that he wore,
And the cross his body o'er came;
Grievous were the sorrows he bore,
But he suffered thus not in vain.
May I to the Fountain be led,
Made to cleanse my sins here below;
Wash me in the blood that he shed,
And I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]

3.
Father, I have wandered from thee,
Often has my heart gone astray:
Crimson do my sins seem to me,
Water cannot wash them away.
Jesus, to that Fountain of thine,
Leaning on thy promise I go;
Cleanse me by thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]
