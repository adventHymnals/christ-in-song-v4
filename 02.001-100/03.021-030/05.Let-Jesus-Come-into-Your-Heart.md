```txt
1.
If you are tired of the load of your sin,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
If you desire a new life to begin,
Let Jesus come into your heart.

Chorus:
Just now, your doubtings give o'er;
Just now, reject Him no more;
Just now, throw open the door;
Let Jesus come into your heart.

2.
If 'tis for purity now that you sigh,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
Fountains for cleansing are flowing near by,
Let Jesus come into your heart.  [Chorus]

3.
If there's a tempest your voice cannot still,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
If there's a void this world never can fill,
Let Jesus come into your heart.  [Chorus]

4.
If friends, once trusted, have proven untrue,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
Find what a Friend He will be unto you.
Let Jesus come into your heart.  [Chorus]

5.
If you would join the glad songs of the blest,
Let Jesus come into your heart:
If you would enter the mansions of rest,
Let Jesus come into your heart.

Chorus:
Just now, my doubtings are o'er; 
Just now, rejecting no more;
Just now, I open the door,
And Jesus comes into my heart.

```
