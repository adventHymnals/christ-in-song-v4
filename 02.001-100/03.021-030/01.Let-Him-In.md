## 021. LET HIM IN
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
There's a Stranger at the door, 
Let him in;
He has been there oft before, 
Let him in;
Let him in, ere he is gone,
Let him in, the Holy One,
Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, 
Let him in.

2.
Open now to him your heart,
Let him in;
If you wait he will depart,
Let him in;
Let him in, he is your friend,
And your soul he will defend;
He will keep you to the end, 
Let him in.

3.
Hear you now his pleading voice?
Let him in;
Now, O now make him your choice,
Let him in.
He is standing at the door,
Joy to you he will restore,
And his name you will adore,
Let him in.

4.
Now admit the heav'nly guest,
Let him in:
He will make for you a feast,
Let him in;
He will speak your sins forgiv'n,
And when earth ties all are riv'n,
He will take your home to heav'n,
Let him in.
