####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Hear the words our Saviour hath spoken,
Words of life, unfailing and true;
Careless one, prayerless one, hear and remember,
Jesus says, "Blessed are they that do."

Chorus:
Blessed are they that do his commandments,
Blessed are they, blessed are they;
Blessed are they that do his commandments,
Blessed, blessed, blessed are they.

2.
All in vain we hear his commandments,
All in vain his promises, too;
Hearing them, fearing them, never can save us,
Blessed, O blessed are they that do.  [Chorus]

3.
They with joy may enter the city,
Free from sin, from sorrow and strife,
Sanctified, glorified, now and forever,
They may have right to the tree of life.  [Chorus]
