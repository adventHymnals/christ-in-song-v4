```txt
1.
Are you tenting on the lowlands
Of the fated, flow'ry plain?
Are you nearing life's high mountains,
As the night comes on again?  

Chorus:
Keep tenting toward the highlands,
Each evening nearer home,
Keep tenting toward the highlands,
Keep tenting nearer home.

2.
Does fair Sodom in her glory
Beckon you with ease or gain?
Heed her awful judgment story;
Linger not, her joys are vain.  [Chorus]

3.
To the mountains of salvation!
Hear the angel, Mercy, call;
Do not tarry!  look not backward!
Hasten on ere vengeance fall.  [Chorus]
