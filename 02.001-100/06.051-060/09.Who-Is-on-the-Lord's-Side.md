####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Who is on the Lord's side?
Always true;
There's a right and wrong side,
Where stand you?

Chorus:
Choose now, 
Choose now,
On the right or wrong side?
False or true?
Choose now,
Choose now,
On the right or wrong side?
Where stand you?

2.
Thousands on the wrong side
Choose to stand;
Still 'tis not the strong side,
True and grand.  [Chorus]

3.
Come and join the Lord's side;
Ask you why?
'Tis the only safe side 
By and by.  [Chorus]

```
