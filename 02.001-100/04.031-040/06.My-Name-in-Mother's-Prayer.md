        Christ in Song 036. My Name in Mother's Prayer. 'Twas in the days of careless youth, when life was fair and bright, And ne'er a tear, and scarce a fear o'ercast my day and night, As in the quiet eventide, I pass'd her kneeling there, That just one word, my name, I heard my name in mother's pray'r. Chorus: My name in mother's pray'r. My name in mother's pray'r. That just one word, my name I heard. I heard my name in mother's pray'r.

1.
'Twas in the days of careless youth, when life was fair and bright,
And ne'er a tear, and scarce a fear o'ercast my day and night,
As in the quiet eventide, I pass'd her kneeling there,
That just one word, my name, I heard my name in mother's pray'r.

Chorus:
My name in mother's pray'r.
My name in mother's pray'r.
That just one word, my name I heard.
I heard my name in mother's pray'r.

2.
I thought but little of it then, tho' rev'rence touch'd my heart,
To her whose love sought from above for me the better part;
But when life's sterner battles came with many a subtle snare,
Oft that one word, in thought I heard my name in mother's pray'r.  [Chorus]

3.
I wandered on, and heeded not God's oft repeated call
To turn from sin, to live for Him, and trust to Him my all;
But when at last, convinced of sin, I sank in deep despair,
My hope awoke, when mem'ry spoke my name in mother's pray'r.  [Chorus]

4.
That pleading heart, that soul so tried, has gone into her rest,
But still with me for aye shall be the mem'ry of her trust,
And when I cross the Jordan's tide, and meet her over there,
We'll praise the Lord, who bless'd that word, my name in mother's pray'r.  [Chorus]
