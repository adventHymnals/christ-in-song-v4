1.
O hear my cry, be gracious now to me,
Come, Great Deliv'rer, come;
My soul bowed down is longing now for Thee,
Come, Great Deliv'rer, come.

Refrain:
I've wander'd far away o'er mountains cold,
I've wander'd far away from home;
O take me now, and bring me to Thy fold,
Come, Great Deliv'rer, come

2.
I have no place, no shelter from the night,
Come, Great Deliv'rer, come;
One look from Thee would give me life and light,
Come, Great Deliv'rer, come.  [Refrain]

3.
My path is lone, and weary are my feet,
Come, Great Deliv'rer, come;
Mine eyes look up Thy loving smile to meet,
Come, Great Deliv'rer, come,  [Refrain]

4.
Thou wilt not spurn contrition's broken sigh,
Come, Great Deliv'rer, come;
Regard my prayer, and hear my humble cry,
Come, Great Deliv'rer, come.  [Refrain]
