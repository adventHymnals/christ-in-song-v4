```txt
1.
Behold, behold the Lamb of God,
On the cross, on the cross;
For you He shed His precious blood,
On the cross, on the cross;
O hear His agonizing cry,
"Eloi, lama, sabachthani,"
Draw near, and see your Saviour die,
On the cross, on the cross.

2.
Behold His arms extended wide,
On the cross, on the cross;
Behold His bleeding hands and side,
On the cross, on the cross;
The sun withholds his rays of light,
The heav'ns are clothed in shades of night.
While Jesus doth for sinners fight,
On the cross, on the cross.

3.
And now the mighty deed is done,
On the cross, on the cross;
The battle fought, the vict'ry won,
On the cross, on the cross;
"'Tis finished," now the Saviour cries;
To heav'n He turns His languid eyes;
Then bows His sacred head, and dies,
On the cross, on the cross. 

4.
Where e'er I go, I'll tell the story
Of the cross, of the cross;
In nothing else my soul shall glory,
Save the cross, save the cross;
And this my constant theme shall be,
Thro' time and in eternity,
That Jesus shed His blood for me,
On the cross, on the cross.
