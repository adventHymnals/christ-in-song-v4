1.
There's a great day coming,
A great day coming,
There's a great day coming by and by,
When the saints and the sinners shall be parted right and left
Are you ready for that day to come?

Chorus:
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready for the judgment day?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?  
for the judgment day?

2.
There's a bright day coming,
A bright day coming,
There's a bright day coming by and by,
But its brightness shall only come to them that love the Lord,
Are you ready for that day to come?  [Chorus]

3.
There's a sad day coming,
A sad day coming,
There's a sad day coming by and by,
When the sinner shall hear his doom "Depart, I know ye not,"
Are you ready for that day to come?  [Chorus]
