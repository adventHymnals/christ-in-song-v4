        Christ in Song 090. I Stood Outside the Gate. I stood outside the gate, A poor, wayfaring child: Within my heart there beat A tempest loud and wild; A fear oppressed my soul, That I might be too late; And oh, I trembled sore, And pray'd outside the gate, And pray'd outside the gate.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I stood outside the gate,
A poor, wayfaring child:
Within my heart there beat
A tempest loud and wild;
A fear oppressed my soul,
That I might be too late;
And oh, I trembled sore,
And pray'd outside the gate,
And pray'd outside the gate.

2.
"O Mercy!" loud I cried,
"Now give me rest from sin!"
"I will," a voice replied;
And Mercy let me in;
She bound my bleeding wounds,
And soothed my heart, opprest;
She washed away my guilt
And gave me peace and rest,
And gave me peace and rest. 

3.
In Mercy's guise I knew
The Saviour long abused,
Who often sought my heart,
And wept when I refused;
Oh!  what a blest return
For all my years of sin!
I stood outside the gate,
And Jesus let me in,
And Jesus let me in,
