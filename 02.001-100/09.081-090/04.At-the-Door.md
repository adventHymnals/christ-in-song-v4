        Christ in Song 084. At the Door. The mistakes of my life are many, The sins of my heart are more, And I scarce can see for weeping, But I knock at the open door. Chorus: I know I am weak and sinful, It comes to me more and more; But since the dear Saviour has bid me come in, I'll enter the open door.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The mistakes of my life are many,
The sins of my heart are more,
And I scarce can see for weeping,
But I knock at the open door.

Chorus:
I know I am weak and sinful,
It comes to me more and more;
But since the dear Saviour has bid me come in,
I'll enter the open door.

2.
I am lowest of those who love Him,
I am weakest of those who pray;
But I come as He has bidden,
And He will not say me nay.  [Chorus]

3.
My mistakes His free grace will cover,
My sins He will wash away,
And the feet that shrink and falter,
Shall walk thro' the gates of day.  [Chorus]

```
