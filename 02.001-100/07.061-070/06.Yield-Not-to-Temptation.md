```txt
1.
Yield not to temptation,
For yielding is sin,
Each vict'ry will help you
Some other to win;
Fight manfully onward,
Dark passions subdue.
Look ever to Jesus,
He'll carry you through.

Chorus:
Ask the Saviour to help you,
Comfort, strengthen, and keep you;
He is willing to aid you,
He will carry you through.

2.
Shun evil companions,
Bad language disdain,
God's name hold in rev'rence,
Nor take it in vain;
Be thoughtful and earnest,
Kindhearted and true,
Look ever to Jesus, 
He'll carry you through.  [Chorus]

3.
To him that o'ercometh,
God giveth a crown,
Through faith we shall conquer,
Tho' often cast down;
He who is our Saviour,
Our strength will renew.
Look ever to Jesus,
He'll carry you through.  [Chorus]
