####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
There's life in a look at the sacred cross,
Jesus has said, "Look unto me;"
Earth with its riches is only dross,
Bright treasures beyond in the cross I see.

Chorus:
In a look there's life for thee,
In a look at Calvary;
Blessed thought, Salvation free,
By a look at Calvary.

2.
When first to the Saviour I raised my eyes,
Sweet was the smile that fell on me;
Oft as the clouds of temptation rise,
A look at the cross still my strength shall be.  [Chorus]

3.
I'll look to the cross ev'ry day and hour,
Trusting the promise God has given;
None ever fall neath the tempter's pow'r,
Who trust and obey in the strength of Heav'n.  [Chorus]

```
