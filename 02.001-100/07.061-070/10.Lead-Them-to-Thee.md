####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Lead them, my God, to Thee,
Lead them to Thee,
These children dear of mine,
Thou gavest me;
O, by Thy love divine,
Lead them, my God, to Thee;
Lead them, my God, to Thee,
Lead them to Thee.

2.
When earth looks bright and fair,
Festive and gay,
Let no delusive snare,
Lure them astray;
But from temptations' pow'r,
Lead them, my God, to Thee;
Lead them, my God, to Thee, 
Lead them to Thee.

3.
E'en for such little ones,
Christ came a child,
And in this world of sin
Lived undefiled.
O, for His sake, I pray,
Lead them, my God, to Thee;
Lead them, my God, to Thee, 
Lead them to Thee.

4.
Yea, tho' my faith be dim,
I would believe
That Thou this precious gift
Wilt now receive;
O, take their young hearts now,
Lead them, my God, to Thee;
Lead them, my God, to Thee,
Lead them to Thee.
