####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
My blessed Lord was crucified;
The day was dark and grief was wide;
For hope was crushed, and all seemed vain,
Until the Saviour rose again.

Refrain:
Ring out the blessed news again!
Oh!  bear aloft the strain;
The mighty Lord is risen in pow'r;
He died, but not in vain.

2.
He brings His great salvation nigh,
And on His love bids us rely;
He bought our peace thro'grief and pain
But oh!  He did not die in vain.  [Refrain]

3.
O, wondrous news of life and love!
That Jesus lives and reigns above;
He made the path of glory plain;
Ah, no!  He did not die in vain.  [Refrain]
