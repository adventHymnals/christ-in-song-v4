1.
Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole;
I want thee forever, to live in my soul;
Break down ev'ry idol, cast out ev'ry foe;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Chorus:
Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

2.
Lord Jesus, look down from thy throne in the skies,
And help me to make a complete sacrifice;
I give up myself, and whatever I know;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]

3.
Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;
I wait, blessed Lord, at thy crucified feet,
By faith,for my cleansing, I see thy blood flow; 
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]

4.
Lord Jesus, thou seest I patiently wait;
Come now, and within me a new heart create;
To those who have sought thee, then never said'st No;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]
