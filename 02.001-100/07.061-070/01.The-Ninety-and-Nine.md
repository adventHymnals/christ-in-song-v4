        Christ in Song 061. The Ninety and Nine. There were ninety and nine that safely lay In the shelter of the fold, But one was out on the hills away, Far off from the gates of gold; Away on the mountains wild and bare, Away from the tender Shepherd's care, Away from the tender Shepherd's care.

1.
There were ninety and nine that safely lay
In the shelter of the fold,
But one was out on the hills away,
Far off from the gates of gold;
Away on the mountains wild and bare,
Away from the tender Shepherd's care,
Away from the tender Shepherd's care.

2.
"Lord, thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;
Are they not enough for Thee?"
But the Shepherd made answer:  "One of mine
Has wander'd away from me,
And although the road be rough and steep,
I go to the desert to find my sheep,
I go to the desert to find my sheep."

3.
But none of the ransom'd ever knew
How deep were the waters cross'd;
Nor how dark was the night that the Lord pass'd thro'
Ere He found His sheep that was lost.
Out in the desert He heard its cry,
Sick and helpless, and ready to die.
Sick and helpless, and ready to die.

4.
"Lord, whence are these blood drops all the way
That mark out the mountains' track?"
They were shed for one who has gone astray,
Ere the Shepherd could bring him back."
"Lord, why are thy hands so rent and torn?"
They are pierc'd to-night by many a thorn."
"They are pierc'd to-night by many a thorn."

5.
But all through the mountains, thunder riven,
And up from the rocky steep,
There rose a cry to the gate of heaven,
"Rejoice, I have found my sheep!"
And the angels sang around the throne,
"Rejoice for the Lord brings back His own!"
