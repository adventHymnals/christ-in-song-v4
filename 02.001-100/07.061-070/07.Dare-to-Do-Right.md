```txt
1.
Dare to do right, dare to be true!
You have a work that no other can do;
Do it so bravely, so kindly, so well,
Angels will hasten the story to tell;
Angels will hasten the story to tell.

Chorus:
Dare to do right,
Dare to be true,
Dare!  dare!  dare to be true!

2.
Dare to do right, dare to be true!
Other men's failures can never save you;
Stand by your conscience, your honor, your faith;
Stand like a hero and battle till death;
Angels will hasten the story to tell.  [Chorus]

3.
Dare to do right, dare to be true!
God who created you cares for you too;
Treasures the tears that his striving ones shed,
Counts and protects ev'ry hair of your head;
Angels will hasten the story to tell.  [Chorus]

4.
Dare to do right, dare to be true!
Keep the great Judgment day always in view;
Look at your work as you'll look at it then
Scann'd by Jehovah, and angels, and men;
Angles will hasten the story to tell.  [Chorus]

5.
Dare to do right, dare to be true!
Jesus, your Saviour, will carry you through;
City, and mansion, and throne, all in sight,
Can you not dare to be true and do right?  
Angels will hasten the story to tell.  [Chorus]
