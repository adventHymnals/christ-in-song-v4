####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Who'll be the next to follow Jesus?
Who'll be the next His cross to bear?
Some one is ready, some one is waiting;
Who'll be the next a crown to wear?

Refrain:
Who'll be the next?
Who'll be the next?
Who'll be the next to follow Jesus?
Who'll be the next to follow Jesus now?
Follow Jesus now?

2.
Who'll be the next to follow Jesus
Follow His weary bleeding feet?
Who'll be the next to lay ev'ry burden
Down at the Father's mercy-seat?  [Chorus]

3.
Who'll be the next to follow Jesus?
Who'll be the next to praise His name?
Who'll swell the chorus of free redemption
Sing, hallelujah!  praise the Lamb?  [Chorus]

```
