####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I will early seek the Saviour,
I will learn of Him each day;
I will follow in His footsteps,
I will walk the narrow way.

Chorus:
For He loves me, yes, He loves me,
Jesus loves me, this I know;
Jesus loves me, died to save me,
This is why I love Him so.

2.
I will hasten where He bids me,
I am not too young to go,
In the pathway where He leadeth,
Not too young His will to know.  [Chorus]

3.
He is standing at the doorway
Of escape from ev'ry sin;
I will knock, for He has promised,
He will hear and let me in.  [Chorus]
