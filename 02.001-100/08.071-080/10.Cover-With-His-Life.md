## 080. COVER WITH HIS LIFE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Look upon Jesus, sinless is He;
Father, impute His life unto me.
My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
Cover with His life, whiter than snow.

Refrain:
Cover with His life, whiter than snow,
Fulness of His life then shall I know;
My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
Cover with His life, whiter than snow.

2.
Deep are the wounds transgression has made;
Red are the stains, my soul is afraid,
O to be covered, Jesus, with Thee,
Safe from the law that now judgeth me!  [Refrain]

3.
Longing the joy of pardon to know,
Jesus holds out a robe white as snow:
"Lord, I accept it!  leaving my own,
Gladly I wear Thy pure life alone."  [Refrain]

4.
Reconciled by His death for my sin,
Justified by His life pure and clean,
Sanctified by obeying His word,
Glorified when returneth my Lord.  [Refrain]
