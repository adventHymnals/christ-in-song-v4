####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Where is my wand'ring boy to-night
The boy of my tenderest care,
The boy that was once my joy and light,
The child of my love and prayer?

Chorus:
O where is my boy to-night?
O where is my boy to-night?
My heart o'erflows, for I love him, he knows;
O where is my boy to-night?

2.
Once he was pure as morning dew,
As he knelt at his mother's knee;
No face was so bright, no heart more true,
And none was so sweet as he.  [Chorus]

3.
O could I see you now, my boy,
As fair as is olden time,
When prattle and smile made home a joy,
And life was a merry chime;  [Chorus]

4.
Go for my wand'ring boy to-night;
Go, search for him where you will;
But bring him to me with all his blight,
And tell him I love him still.  [Chorus]
