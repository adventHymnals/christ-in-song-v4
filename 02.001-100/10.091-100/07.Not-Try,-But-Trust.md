        Christ in Song 097. Not Try, But Trust. Not saved are we by trying, From self can come no aid; 'Tis on the blood relying, Once for our ransom paid; 'Tis looking unto Jesus, The holy One and just; 'Tis His great work that saves us, It is not Try, but Trust. Chorus:  It is not Try, but Trust, It is not Try, but Trust;  'Tis His great work that saves us; It is not Try, but Trust.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Not saved are we by trying,
From self can come no aid;
'Tis on the blood relying,
Once for our ransom paid;
'Tis looking unto Jesus,
The holy One and just;
'Tis His great work that saves us,
It is not Try, but Trust.

Chorus:  It is not Try, but Trust,
It is not Try, but Trust; 
'Tis His great work that saves us;
It is not Try, but Trust.

2.
'Twas vain for Israel bitten
By serpents on their way,
To look to their own doing,
That awful plague to stay;
The remedy and healing,
When humbled in the dust,
Was of the Lord's revealing,
It is not Try, but Trust.  [Chorus]

3.
No deeds of ours are needed
To make Christ's merit more;
No frames of mind, or feelings,
Can add to His great store;
'Tis simply to receive Him,
The holy One and just,
'Tis only to believe Him,
It is not Try, but Trust.  [Chorus]
