####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The great Physician now is near,
The sympathizing Jesus;
He speaks, the drooping heart to cheer,
O hear the voice of Jesus!

Chorus:
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue,
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus!

2.
Your many sins are all forgiv'n,
O hear the voice of Jesus;
Go on your way in peace to heav'n,
And wear a crown with Jesus.   [Chorus]

3.
All glory to the dying Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus;
I love the blessed Saviour's name,
I love the name of Jesus.  [Chorus]

4.
His name dispels my guilt and fear;
No other name but Jesus;
O how my soul delights to hear
The precious name of Jesus!  [Chorus]

5.
And when he comes to bring the crown,
The crown of life and glory;
Then by his side we will sit down,
And tell redemption's story.  [Chorus]
