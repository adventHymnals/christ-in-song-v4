####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Come, ev'ry soul by sin oppressed,
There's mercy with the Lord,
And he will surely give you rest,
By trusting in his word.

Chorus:
Only trust him, only trust him,
Only trust him now;
He will save you, he will save you,
He will save you now.

2.
For Jesus shed his precious blood
Rich blessings to bestow;
Plunge now into the crimson flood
That washes white as snow.  [Chorus]

3.
Yes, Jesus is the Truth, the Way,
That Leads you into rest;
Believe in him without delay,
And you are fully blest.  [Chorus]

4.
Come, then, and join this holy band,
And on to glory go,
To dwell in that celestial land,
Where joys immortal flow.  [Chorus]
