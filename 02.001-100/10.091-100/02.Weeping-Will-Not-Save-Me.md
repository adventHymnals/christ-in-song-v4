## 092. WEEPING WILL NOT SAVE ME
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Weeping will not save me
Tho' my face were bathed in tears,
That could not allay my fears,
Could not wash the sins of years
Weeping will not save me.

Refrain:
Jesus wept and died for me;
Jesus suffered on the tree;
Jesus waits to make me free;
He alone can save me.

2.
Working will not save me
Purest deeds that I can do,
Holiest thoughts and feelings, too,
Can not form my soul anew
Working will not save me.  [Refrain]

3.
Waiting will not save me
Helpless, guilty, lost I lie,
In my ear is mercy's cry;
If I wail I can but die
Waiting will not save me.  [Refrain]

4.
Faith in Christ will save me
Let me trust thy weeping Son,
Trust the work that he has done;
To his arms, Lord, help me run
Faith in Christ will save me.  [Refrain]
