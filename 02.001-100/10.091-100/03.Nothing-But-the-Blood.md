####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
What can make me pure within?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Refrain:
Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow;
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

2.
For my cleansing this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
For my pardon this my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  [Refrain]

3.
Nothing can for sin atone
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
Naught of good that I have done
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  [Refrain]

4.
This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  [Refrain]

5.
Glory!  glory!  thus I sing
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
All my praise for this I bring
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  [Refrain]
