        Christ in Song 100. Nothing for Jesus. Crowded is your heart with cares, Have you no room for Jesus: Captured by earth's golden snares, Have you no room for Jesus? Lo!  he's standing at your door, Knocking, knocking o'er and o'er; Hear him pleading evermore; Have you no room for Jesus?

## 100. NOTHING FOR JESUS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Crowded is your heart with cares,
Have you no room for Jesus:
Captured by earth's golden snares,
Have you no room for Jesus?
Lo!  he's standing at your door,
Knocking, knocking o'er and o'er;
Hear him pleading evermore;
Have you no room for Jesus?

2.
Wasting all your precious hours,
Have you no work for Jesus?
Spending these God-given pow'rs,
Have you no work for Jesus?
Striving not to conquer sin,
Seeking not a soul to win,
Bringing not a wand'rer in;
Have you no work for Jesus?

3.
Seeking earth's possessions fair,
Have you no time for Jesus?
None for gracious deeds to spare,
Have you no time for Jesus?
Not a grain to store away,
Naught your labor to replay,
Not a joy for that great day
When you shall meet with Jesus.

4.
Bearing only worthless leaves,
Have you no fruit for Jesus?
In your hands no precious sheaves,
Have you no fruit for Jesus?
Not a grain to store away,
Naught your labor to repay,
Not a joy for that great day
When you shall meet with Jesus.
