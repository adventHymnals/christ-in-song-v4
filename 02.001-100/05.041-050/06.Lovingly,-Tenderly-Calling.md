1.
Jesus, the loving Shepherd,
Calleth thee now to come
Into the fold of safety,
Where there is rest and room;
Come in the strength of manhood,
Come in the morn of youth,
Enter the fold of safety,
Enter the way of truth.

Chorus: 
Lovingly, tenderly calling is he;
Wanderer, wanderer, come unto me,
Patiently standing there, waiting,
I See Jesus my Shepherd divine.

2.
Jesus, the loving Shepherd,
Gave his dear life for thee,
Tenderly now he's calling,
Wanderer, come to me;
Haste, for without is danger,
Come, cries the Shepherd blest,
Enter the fold of safety,
Enter the place of rest.  [Chorus]

3.
Lingering is but folly,
Wolves are abroad today,
Seeking the sheep now straying,
Seeking the lambs to stay;
Jesus, the loving Shepherd,
Calleth thee now to come
Into the fold of safety,
When there is rest and room.  [Chorus]
