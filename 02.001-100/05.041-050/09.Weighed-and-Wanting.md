####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
When the Judge shall weigh our motives,
For eternal gain or loss,
Shall we stand as gold before him?
Or as vile and worthless dross?

Refrain:
Weigh'd in the balance of the Lord,
Weigh'd, weigh'd, and wanting;
Weigh'd by the standard of his word,
Weigh'd, weigh'd, and wanting.

2.
Shall we hear the glad words spoken:
"Faithful servant," and "Well done,"
Or the dread and awful sentence,
"Thou are wanting," sinful one?  [Refrain]

3.
Shall we heed the Spirit's pleading,
While for mercy we may call,
Or delay till God's handwriting
Seals the final doom of all?  [Refrain]

```
