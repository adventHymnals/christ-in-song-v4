####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O who is this that cometh
From Edom's crimson plain,
With wounded side, with garments dyed?
O tell me now thy name.
"I that saw thy soul's distress,
A ransom gave;
I that speak in righteousness,
Mighty to save."

Refrain:
Mighty to save,
Mighty to save,
Mighty to save;
Lord, I trust thy wondrous love,
Mighty to save.

2.
O why is thine apparel
With reeking gore all dyed,
Like them that tread the winepress red?
O why this bloody tide?
I the wine-press trod alone, 
"Neath dark'ning skies;
Of the people there was none
Mighty to save."  [Chorus]

3.
O bleeding Lamb, my Saviour!
How could'st thou bear this shame?
"With mercy fraught, mine own arm brought
Salvation in my name;
I the bloody fight have won,
Conquer'd the grave,
Now the year of joy has come,
Mighty to save."  [Chorus]
