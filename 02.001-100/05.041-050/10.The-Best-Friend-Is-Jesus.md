1.
Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus,
When the cares of life upon you roll,
He will heal the wounded heart,
He will strength and grace impart;
Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.

Chorus:
The best friend to have is Jesus,
The best friend to have is Jesus,
He will help you when you fall,
He will hear you when you call;
Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.

2.
What a friend I have found in Jesus!
Peace and comfort to my soul He brings;
Leaning on His mighty arm,
I will fear no ill nor harm;
Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.  [Chorus]

3.
Tho' I pass thro' the night of sorrow,
And the chilly waves of Jordan roll,
Never need I shrink nor fear,
For my Saviour is so near;
Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.  [Chorus]

4.
When at last to our home we gather,
With the faithful who have gone before,
We will sing upon the shore,
Praising Him forevermore;
Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.  [Chorus]
