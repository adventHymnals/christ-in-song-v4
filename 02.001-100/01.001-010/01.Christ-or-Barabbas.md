####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
What shall I do with Jesus?
He stands before me now,
Wearing the robe of purple,
And thorns upon His brow.

Refrain:
This is the question now;
What shall the answer be?
Shall I crucify King Jesus,
And set Barabbas free?

2.
Shall I release the robber,
The carnal man of pride?
Sin or a sinless Saviour?--
O which shall be denied?

Refrain:
This is the question now;
What shall the answer be?
Shall I crucify King Jesus,
And set Barabbas free?

3.
Solemn and awful question!  
How still the balance stands!
Mercy a moment lingers,
It trembles in her hands.

Refrain:
This is the question now;
What shall the answer be?
Shall I crucify King Jesus,
And set Barabbas free?

4.
Self on the seat of judgment,
Dare you the world deny?
Louder and louder calling,
"Away!"  and "Crucify!"

Refrain:
This is the question now;
What shall the answer be?
Shall I crucify King Jesus,
And set Barabbas free?

5.
Not to the sinner only,
The question comes with pow'r;
Hear it, ye halting Christians,
In ev'ry trial hour.

Refrain:
This is the question now;
What shall the answer be?
I will crucify Barabbas,
And set King Jesus free.
