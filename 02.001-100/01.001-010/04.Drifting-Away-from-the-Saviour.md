## 004. DRIFTING AWAY FROM THE SAVIOUR
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Drifting away from the Saviour,
Casting reproach on the Lord;
Drifting away from His temple,
Heeding no longer His word.

Refrain:
Drifting away, drifting away,
Drifting away from the Saviour,
Drifting, still drifting away.

2.
Drifting away from the Saviour,
Slighting and grieving His love;
Drifting away from the mansions
He is preparing above.  [Refrain]

3.
Drifting away from the Saviour, 
Lonely and helpless thou art;
Drifting away from His people,
Ever so dear to His heart.  [Refrain]

4.
Drifting away from the Saviour,
He who has showed you the way;
Drifting away from His teaching,
Farther and farther each day.  [Refrain]

5.
Drifting away from the Saviour,
Still He is mindful of thee.
Come unto Him and believing,
Pardon'd thro' grace thou shalt be.  [Refrain]
