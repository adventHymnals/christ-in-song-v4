        Christ in Song 018. Just One Touch. Just one touch as He moves along, Pushed and press'd by the jostling throng, Just one touch and the weak was strong, Cured by the Healer divine. Chorus: Just one touch as He passes by, He will list to the faintest cry; Come and be saved while the Lord is nigh, Christ is the Healer divine.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Just one touch as He moves along,
Pushed and press'd by the jostling throng,
Just one touch and the weak was strong,
Cured by the Healer divine.

Chorus:
Just one touch as He passes by,
He will list to the faintest cry;
Come and be saved while the Lord is nigh,
Christ is the Healer divine.

2.
Just one touch and He makes me whole,
Speaks sweet peace to my sin sick soul,
At His feet all my burdens roll,
Cured by the Healer divine.  [Chorus]

3.
Just on touch and the work is done,
I am saved by the blessed Son,
I will sing while the ages run,
Cured by the Healer divine.  [Chorus]

4.
Just one touch and He turns to me,
O the love in His eyes I see!
I am His, for He hears my plea,
Cured by the Healer divine  [Chorus]

5.
Just one touch; by His mighty pow'r
He can heal thee this very hour,
Give sweet peace, tho' the tempests low'r,
Cured by the Healer divine.  [Chorus]
