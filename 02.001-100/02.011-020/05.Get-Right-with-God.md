        Christ in Song 015. Get Right with God. In darkness I lingered 'mid doubt and despair, Sin's bondage long held me a captive to care; But Jesus delivered my soul from its chains, His precious blood cleans'd me from sin's guilty stains. Chorus: Get right with God! His pardon is free, Get right with God, He's waiting for thee; Our Jesus is calling, "Oh, come unto me!" Take Him, O sinner, and get right with God.

1.
In darkness I lingered 'mid doubt and despair,
Sin's bondage long held me a captive to care;
But Jesus delivered my soul from its chains,
His precious blood cleans'd me from sin's guilty stains.

Chorus:
Get right with God!
His pardon is free,
Get right with God,
He's waiting for thee;
Our Jesus is calling, "Oh, come unto me!"
Take Him, O sinner, and get right with God.

2.
The world and its pleasures did tempt me to stray,
I saw not the danger that lurk'd on the way;
The toils clos'd around me, I knew no release,
But Jesus has found me and giv'n me His peace.  [Chorus]

3.
The pathway to Calv'ry is toilsome and hard,
Yet tread it, O faint me, and find thy reward;
Here lay down thy burden, and wash in the stream
That flows like a fountain thy soul to redeem.  [Chorus]

4.
Repent while He calls thee, while yet it is day,
Take with thee His gift of free pardon away;
Take Christ for thy Saviour, Redeemer, and Friend, His love will sustain thee secure to the end.  [Chorus]
