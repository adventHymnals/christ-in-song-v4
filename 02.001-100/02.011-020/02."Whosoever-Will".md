"Whosoever heareth," shout, shout the sound!
Send the blessed tidings all the world around;
Spread the joyful news wherever man is found:

Send the proclamation over vale and hill;
'Tis a loving Father calls the wand'rer home:
"Whosoever will, may come."

Now the door is open, enter while you may;
Jesus is the true, the only Living Way:
"Whosoever will, may come."  [Chorus]

"Whosoever will," for ever must endure;
