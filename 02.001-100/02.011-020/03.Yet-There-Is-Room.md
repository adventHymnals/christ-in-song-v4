####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
"Yet there is room!"  
The Lamb's bright hall of song,
With its fair glory, 
beckons thee along;

Refrain:
Room, room, 
yet there is room;
Come, come, 
come while there's room.

2.
Daylight declines, 
The sun is sinking low;
The shadows lengthen,
light makes haste to go:  [Refrain]

3.
The bridal hall 
is filling for the feast:
Pass in!  pass in! 
and be the Bridegroom's guest;  [Refrain]

4.
It fills, it fills, 
that hall of jubilee!
Make haste, make haste; 
'tis not too full for thee:  [Refrain]

5.
Yet there is room!
Still open stands the gate,
The gate of love;
it is not yet too late:  [Refrain]

6.
Pass in, pass in!  
That banquet is for thee;
That cup of everlasting 
love is free:  [Refrain]

7.
All heaven is there,
all joy!  Go in, go in;
The angels beckon thee
the prize to win:  [Refrain]

8.
Soon night will close that gate
and seal thy doom:
Then the sad cry,
"No more for me, no room!'  [Refrain]
