    1.
    On the shore beyond the sea,
    Where the fields are bright and fair,
    There's a call a plaintive plea,
    I must hasten to be there.

    Chorus:
    Let me go, I cannot stay,
    'Tis the Master calling me;
    Let me go, I must obey;
    Native land, farewell to thee.

    2.
    Hark!  I hear the Master say,
    "Up, ye reapers!  why so slow?"
    To the vineyard, far away,
    Earthly kindred, let me go.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Just beyond the rolling tide,
    The uplifted hand I see;
    Lo!  the gates are open wide,
    And the lost are calling me.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Father, mother, darling child,
    I must bid you all adieu;
    For across the waters wild,
    There's a work for me to do.  [Chorus]
