    1.
    I must have the Saviour with me,
    For I dare not walk alone;
    I must feel His presence near me,
    And His arm around me thrown.

    Chorus:
    Then my soul shall fear no ill,
    Let Him lead me where He will,
    I will go without a murmur,
    And His footsteps follow still.

    2.
    I must have the Saviour with me,
    For my faith, at best, is weak;
    He can whisper words of comfort
    That no other voice can speak.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I must have the Saviour with me,
    In the onward march of life, 
    Thro' the tempest and the sunshine,
    Thro' the battle and the strife.  [Chorus]

    4.
    I must have the Saviour with me,
    And His eye the way must guide,
    Till I reach the vale of Jordan,
    Till I gain the other side.  [Chorus]
