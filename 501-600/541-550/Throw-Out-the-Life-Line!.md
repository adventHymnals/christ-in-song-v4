    1.
    Out upon an angry ocean,
    Without helm or oar,
    Millions in the wild commotion,
    Sink to rise no more.

    Chorus:
    Throw out the life-line!  Throw out the life-line!
    Night is swiftly coming; Behold the setting sun!
    Throw out the life-line!  throw out the life-line!
    Jesus is the life-line; You may save one.

    2.
    On a flow'ry gospel meadow,
    Thousands dwell at ease,
    Caring not that Death's dark shadow
    Haunts the stormy seas.  [Chorus]

    3.
    How can we who once were rescued
    At so great a cost,
    Cast adrift the only Life-Line,
    Laughing at the lost!  [Chorus]

    4.
    Brothers, hear your brothers calling,
    "Throw the line this way;"
    Sisters, see your sisters sinking,
    With no arm to stay.  [Chorus]
