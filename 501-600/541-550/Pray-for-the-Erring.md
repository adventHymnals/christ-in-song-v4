    1.
    Pray for the erring ones, faith shall reclaim them;
    Doubt not the promises, plead them in prayer.
    Loving and merciful, Jesus will save them;
    Up to the mercy seat thy loved ones bear.

    Refrain:
    Always pray, pray for the erring;
    Pray in faith, Jesus will hear;
    Always pray, pray for the erring;
    Prayer brings the wand'rers near.

    2.
    Plead with them tenderly, point them to Jesus;
    Tho' justly sorrowing, do not despair.
    Kneel in the darkest hour, firmly believing;
    On Christ the crucified cast all your care.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Let thine example be worthy thy calling,
    Thy life is witnessing each day and hour.
    Thousands now perishing long for a Saviour;
    Show forth his wondrous love, tell of his power.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Walk with the Perfect One, choosing none other;
    His robe of righteousness joyfully wear;
    So shall the erring see beauty in Jesus,
    So shall the Father hear and grant thy prayer.  [Refrain]
