    1.
    Far and near the fields are teeming
    With the sheaves of ripened grain;
    Far and near their gold is gleaming
    O'er the sunny slope and plain.

    Chorus:
    Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!
    Hear us, Lord, to thee we cry;
    Send them now the sheaves to gather,
    Ere the harvest time pass by.

    2.
    Send them forth with morn's first beaming,
    Send them in the noontide's glare;
    When the sun's last rays are streaming,
    Bid them gather ev'rywhere.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O thou whom thy Lord is sending,
    Gather now the sheaves of gold,
    Heav'nward then at evening wending
    Thou shalt come with joy untold.  [Chorus]
