    1.
    One more day's work for Jesus,
    One less of life for me;
    But heav'n is nearer,
    And Christ is dearer,
    Than yesterday to me;
    His love and light
    Fill all my soul tonight.

    Chorus:
    One more day's work for Jesus,
    One more day's work for Jesus,
    One more day's work for Jesus,
    One less of life for me.

    2.
    One more day's work for Jesus;
    How glorious is my King!
    'Tis joy, not duty,
    To speak his beauty;
    My soul mounts on the wing
    At the mere tho't
    How Christ my life has bought.  [Chorus]

    3.
    One more day's work for Jesus;
    How sweet the work has been,
    To tell the story,
    To show the glory
    Where Christ's flock enter in!
    How it did shine
    In this poor heart of mine!  [Chorus]

    4.
    One more day's work for Jesus,
    O yes, a weary day;
    But heav'n shines clearer,
    And rest comes nearer,
    At each step of the way;
    And Christ in all
    Before his face I fall.  [Chorus]

    5.
    O blessed work for Jesus!
    O rest at Jesus' feet!
    There toil seems pleasure,
    My wants are treasure,
    And pain for him is sweet;
    Lord, if I may,
    I'll serve another day.  [Chorus]
