    1.
    Throw out the Life-Line across the dark wave,
    There is a brother whom some one shall save;
    Somebody's brother!  oh, who then, will dare
    To throw out the Life-Line his peril to share?

    Chorus:
    Throw out the Life-Line!  Throw out the Life-Line!
    Some one is drifting away; 
    Throw out the Life-Line!  Throw out the Life-Line!
    Some one is sinking today.

    2.
    Throw out the Life-Line, With hand quick and strong,
    Why do you tarry, why linger so long?
    See!  he is sinking; oh, hasten today
    And out with the Life-Boat!  away, then, away!  [Chorus]

    3.
    Throw out the Life-Line to danger-fraught men,
    Sinking in anguish where you've never been:
    Winds of temptation and billows of woe
    Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Soon will the season of rescue be o'er,
    Soon will they drift to eternity's shore,
    Haste, then, my brother, no time for delay,
    But throw out the Life-Line and save them today.  [Chorus]
