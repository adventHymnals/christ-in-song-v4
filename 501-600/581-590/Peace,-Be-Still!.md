    1.
    Master, the tempest is raging!
    The billows are tossing high!
    The sky is o'ershadow'd with blackness;
    No shelter or help is nigh;
    "Carest thou not that we perish?
    How canst thou lie asleep,
    When each moment so madly is threat'ning
    A grave in the angry deep?

    Chorus:
    "The winds and the waves obey my will,
    Peace, be still!
    Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
    Or demons, or men, or whatever it be,
    No water can swallow the ship where lies
    The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies;
    They all sweetly obey my will;
    Peace, be still!
    Peace, be still!
    They all shall sweetly obey my will;
    Peace, peace, be still!

    2.
    Master, with anguish of spirit
    I bow in my grief today;
    The depths of my sad heart are troubled;
    O waken and save, I pray!
    Torrents of sin and of anguish
    Sweep o'er my sinking soul;
    And I perish, I perish!  dear Master;
    O hasten and take control.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Master, the terror is over,
    The elements sweetly rest;
    Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,
    And heaven's within my breast;
    Linger, O blessed Redeemer,
    Leave me alone no more;
    And with joy I shall make the blest harbor,
    And rest on the blissful shore.  [Chorus]
