[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dBBzYCSvQXIhbAiWwk2wb9ZpcaSyVNuP/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Hear the temp'rance call,
    Freemen one and all,
    Hear your country's  earnest cry;
    See your native land
    Life her beck'ning hand;
    Sons of freedom, come ye nigh.

    Chorus:
    Starve the monster from our shore,
    Let his cruel reign be o'er;
    Starve the monster from our shore,
    Let his cruel reign be o'er.

    2.
    Leave the shop and farm,
    Leave your bright hearths warm;
    Work and pray the lost to save;
    Let your leaders be 
    True and noble, free,
    Fearless, temp'rate, good, and grave.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Hail!  our Fatherland,
    Here thy children stand,
    All resolv'd, united, true;
    In the temp'rance cause 
    Ne'er to faint or pause!
    This our purpose is, and vow.  [Chorus]
