[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d9NK%2DQATTR2bvQ%2DGDA34y8T6TgXuzSwE/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Angry words!  oh, let them never
    From the tongue unbridled slip;
    May the heart's best impulse ever
    Check them e'er they soil the lip.

    Chorus:
    "Love one another," Thus saith the Saviour,
    Children, obey the Father's blest command:
    "Love one another," Thus saith the Saviour,
    Children, obey his blest command.

    2.
    Love is much too pure and holy,
    Friendship is too sacred far,
    For a moment's reckless folly
    Thus to desolate and mar.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Angry words are lightly spoken;
    Bitt'rest tho'ts are rashly stirred
    Brightest links of life are broken,
    By a single angry word.  [Chorus]
