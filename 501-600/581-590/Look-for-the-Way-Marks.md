    1.
    Look for the way-marks as you journey on,
    Look for the way-marks, passing one by one;
    Down thro' the ages, past the kingdoms four,
    Where are we standing?
    Look the way-marks o'er.

    Chorus:
    Look for the way-marks, the great prophetic way-marks,
    Down thro' the ages, past the kingdoms four.
    Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic waymarks;
    The journey's almost o'er.

    2.
    First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world,
    Then Medo Persia's banners were unfurled;
    And after Greece held universal sway,
    Rome seized the scepter,
    Where are we today?  [Chorus]

    3.
    Down in the feet of iron and of clay,
    Weak and divided, soon to pass away;
    What will the next great, glorious drama be?
    Christ and his coming, 
    And eternity.  [Chorus]
