    1.
    He that goeth forth with weeping,
    Bearing precious seed in love,
    Never tiring, never sleeping,
    Findeth mercy from above.

    Chorus:
    Lo, the scene of verdure bright'ning!
    See the rising grain appear;
    Look!  the waving fields are whit'ning,
    For the harvest time is near.

    2.
    Soft descend the dews of heaven,
    Bright the rays celestial shine;
    Precious fruits will thus be given
    Thro' an influence all divine.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Sow thy seed, be never weary,
    Let no fears thy soul annoy;
    Be the prospect ne'er so dreary,
    Thou shalt reap the fruits of joy.  [Chorus]
