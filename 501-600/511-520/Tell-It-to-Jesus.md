    1.
    Are you weary, are you heavy hearted?
    Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus,
    Are you grieving over joys departed?
    Tell it to Jesus alone.

    Chorus:
    Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus,
    He is a friend that's well known;
    You've no other such a friend or brother,
    Tell it to Jesus alone.

    2.
    Do the tears flow down your checks unbidden?
    Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus;
    Have you sins that to the world are hidden?
    Tell it to Jesus alone.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Do you fear the gath'ring clouds of sorrow?
    Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus;
    Are you anxious what shall be tomorrow?  Tell it to Jesus alone.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Are you troubled at the tho't of dying?
    Tell it to Jesus, Tell is to Jesus;
    For Christ's coming kingdom are you sighing?
    Tell it to Jesus alone.  [Chorus]
