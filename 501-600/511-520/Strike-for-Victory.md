    1.
    Strike!  O strike for vict'ry,
    Soldiers of the Lord,
    Hoping in his mercy,
    Trusting in his word;
    Lift the gospel banner
    High above the world;
    Let its folds of beauty
    Ever be unfurled.

    Chorus:
    Strike!  strike for vict'ry,
    Heroes bold;
    Strike!  till the vict'ry
    You behold;
    Faith is the vict'ry;
    Ne'er give o'er;
    Rest then in glory
    Evermore.

    2.
    What tho' raging lions
    Meet us on the way!
    Zionward we're marching,
    Tow'rd the gates of day;
    Ever pressing onward,
    Onward to the light,
    Till we reach the Jordan,
    With our home in sight.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Strike!  O strike for vict'ry,
    Heroes of the cross,
    Sacrificing pleasure,
    Glorying in loss;
    Blind the helmet stronger,
    Tighter grasp the sword;
    Conquering and to conquer,
    Battle for the Lord.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Hand to hand united,
    Heart to heart as one,
    Let us still keep marching
    Till our journey's done,
    Till we see the angels
    Come in glory down,
    With the shining garments
    And the victor's crown.  [Chorus]
