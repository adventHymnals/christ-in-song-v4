    1.
    My Father is rich in houses and lands,
    He holdeth the wealth of the world in his hands!
    Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,
    His cotters are full, he has riches untold.

    Chorus:
    I'm a child of the King,
    a child of the King!
    With Jesus, my Saviour,
    I'm a child of the King!

    2.
    My Father's own Son, the Saviour of men,
    Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;
    But now he is pleading for sinners on high,
    And will give me a home when he comes by and by.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I once was an outcast, a stranger on earth,
    A sinner by choice, and an alien by birth!
    But I've been adopted, my name's written down,
    An heir to a mansion, a robe, and a crown.  [Chorus]

    4.
    A tent or a cottage, O why should I care?
    They're building a palace for me over there!
    Tho' exiled from home, yet still I may sing:
    "All glory to God, I'm a child of the King."
