    1.
    'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
    Just to take Him at His word;
    Just to rest upon His promise;
    Just to know, "Thus saith the Lord."

    Refrain:
    Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him;
    How I've prov'd Him o'er and o'er!
    Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
    O for grace to trust Him more!

    2.
    O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
    Just to trust His cleansing blood;
    Just in simple faith to plunge me
    'Neath the healing, cleansing flood.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
    Just from sin and self to cease;
    Just from Jesus simply taking
    Life, and rest, and joy, and peace.  [Refrain]

    4.
    I'm so glad I learn'd to trust Thee,
    Precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend;
    And I know that Thou art with me,
    Wilt be with me till the end.  [Refrain]
