    1.
    Ask not to be excused,
    There's earnest work to do;
    Stand ready to be used
    Where God may station you.
    His invitation kind
    To thee has oft been giv'n;
    Accept, and thou shalt find
    'Tis sweet to work for Heav'n.

    Chorus:
    Come, O come!
    Ask not to be excused;
    Come, O come!
    Stand ready to be used.
    Ask not to be excused,
    This answer may be giv'n:
    Thou hast my love abused,
    Thou art excused from heav'n.

    2.
    Ask not to be excused,
    The Master calls today;
    Too long hast thou refused,
    Now hasten to obey.
    The harvest fields are white,
    The laborers are few;
    Let this be thy delight,
    The Master's work to do  [Chorus]

    3.
    Ask not to be excused,
    There's danger in delay;
    That wondrous love abused,
    Forever turns away.
    While Mercy gently pleads
    And points the way to heav'n,
    While Jesus intercedes,
    O come and be forgiv'n!  [Chorus]
