    1.
    In heav'nly love abiding,
    No change my heart shall fear;
    And safe is such confiding,
    For nothing changes here.
    The storm may roar without me,
    My heart may low be laid,
    But God is round about me,
    And can I be dismayed?
    But God is round about me,
    And can I be dismayed?

    2.
    Wherever he may guide me,
    No want shall turn me back;
    My Shepherd is beside me,
    And nothing can I lack.
    His wisdom ever waketh,
    His sight is never dim,
    He knows the way he taketh,
    And I will walk with him,
    He knows the way he taketh, 
    And I will walk with him.

    3.
    Green pastures are before me,
    Which yet I have not seen;
    Bright skies will soon be o'er me,
    Where darkest clouds have been.
    My hope I cannot measure,
    My path to life is free,
    My Saviour has my treasure,
    And he will walk with me,
    My Saviour has my treasure,
    And he will walk with me.
