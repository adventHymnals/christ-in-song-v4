    1.
    I am thinking today of that beautiful land,
    I shall reach when the sun goeth down;
    When thro' wonderful grace by my Saviour I stand,
    Will there be any stars in my crown?

    Chorus:
    Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown,
    When at evening the sun goeth down?
    When I wake with the blest
    In the mansions of rest,
    Will there be any stars in my crown?

    2.
    In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray;
    Let me watch as a winner of souls;
    That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day,
    When His praise like the sea billows rolls.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O what joy will it be when His face I behold,
    Living gems at His feet to lay down;
    It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold, 
    Should there be any stars in my crown.  [Chorus]
