    1.
    All my class!  not one forgotten
    When before the Throne I kneel;
    I would share the loving burden
    That my Saviour's heart doth feel.

    Refrain:
    Ev'ry one, blessed tho't!
    Not a single name forgot.
    One left out, His joy would dim;
    Ev'ry one is dear to Him.

    2.
    All my class!  if one be missing
    In the glorious gath'ring day,
    How shall I account to Jesus?
    What shall I with weeping say?  [Refrain]

    3.
    Daily would I walk before them,
    Sinless in God's holy sight,
    Pleading till His Spirit draw them,
    Ev'ry one to life and light.  [Refrain]
