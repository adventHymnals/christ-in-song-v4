    1.
    Never be sad or desponding,
    Only have faith to believe;
    Grace, for the duties before thee,
    Ask of thy God and receive.

    Chorus:
    Never give up, 
    Never give up,
    Never give up to thy sorrows,
    Jesus will bid them depart;
    Trust in the Lord,
    Trust in the Lord,
    Sing when your trials are greatest,
    Trust in the Lord and take heart.

    2.
    What if thy burdens oppress thee?
    What tho' thy life may be drear?
    Look, on the side that is brightest,
    Pray, and thy path will be clear.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Never be sad or desponding,
    Lean on the arm of thy Lord;
    Dwell in the depths of His mercy,
    Thou shalt receive thy reward.  [Chorus]
