    1.
    Lonely!  no, not lonely
    While Jesus standeth by;
    His presence always cheers me;
    I know that he is nigh.
    Friendless?  no, not friendless,
    For Jesus is my Friend;
    I change, but he remaineth,
    The same unto the end.

    Chorus:
    No, never alone, no, never alone;
    He has promised never to leave me,
    Never to leave me alone.
    No, never alone, no, never alone;
    He has promised never to leave me,
    Never to leave me alone.

    2.
    Weary?  no, not weary
    While leaning on his breast;
    My soul hath full enjoyment,
    In His eternal rest.
    Helpless?  yes, so helpless;
    But I am leaning hard
    On the mighty arm of Jesus,
    And he is keeping guard.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Waiting?  yes, I'm waiting;
    He bids me watch and wait;
    I only wonder often,
    What makes my Lord so late.
    Joyful?  yes, so joyful,
    With joy too deep for words;
    A precious, sure foundation,
    The joy that is my Lord's.  [Chorus]
