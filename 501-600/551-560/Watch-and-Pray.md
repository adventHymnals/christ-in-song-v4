[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eHYIepClepR9njOE%2DGGNVgUCar8kloPw/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Watch, for the time is short;
    Watch while 'tis called today;
    Watch lest the world prevail;
    Watch, Christian, watch and pray;
    Watch, for the flesh is weak;
    Watch, for the foe is strong;
    Watch lest the Bridegroom come;
    Watch, tho' he tarry long.

    Chorus:
    O watch and pray,
    O watch and pray;
    O watch is the darkness, and watch in the day;
    Christian, watch and pray.

    2.
    Chase slumber from thine eyes,
    Chase doubting from thy breast;
    Thine is the promis'd prize 
    Of heaven's eternal rest;
    Watch, Christian, watch and pray;
    Thy Saviour watched for thee
    Till from his brow there poured
    Great drops of agony.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Take Jesus for thy trust;
    Watch while the foe is near;
    Gird well the armor on;
    Watch till thy Lord appear.
    Now when thy sun is up,
    Make thou no more delay,
    In this accepted time
    Watch, Christian, watch and pray.  [Chorus]
