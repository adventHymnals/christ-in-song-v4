    1.
    When softly fades the dying days,
    And mortal cares we fold away,
    Then with the last faint ray of light
    All nature seems to say good night.

    Refrain:
    Good night, good night,
    May angels bright,
    Their vigils keep till morning light,
    Good night, good night,
    Good night, good night.

    2.
    And when the deeper shadows fall,
    And nature veil as with a pall,
    Then pray'rs of evening take their flight
    From lips that softly say good night.  [Refrain]

    3.
    O Father, give us sweet repose
    From all our earthly cares and woes,
    And grant that heav'n may greet our sight
    When we have said our last good night.  [Refrain]
