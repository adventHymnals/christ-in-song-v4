    1.
    We should be like gardens,
    Bright and sweet with flow'rs,
    Bless'd with heaven's sunshine,
    Cheer'd by gentle show'rs;
    Violets are the kind words,
    Roses, deeds of love,
    Fragrant pinks and pansies,
    Tho'ts of God above.

    Chorus:
    Beautiful flow'rs, beautiful flow'rs,
    Bright with morning dew;
    Beautiful flow'rs, beautiful flow'rs,
    We would be like you.

    2.
    Not a frown of anger,
    Not a shade of care,
    Not one look of sadness
    Do the blossoms wear;
    They are always trusting,
    This is how they grow
    Beautiful and fragrant,
    In a world of woe.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Selfish tho'ts and wishes,
    Unkind words and deeds,
    Are like cruel brambles,
    Thistles, thorns, and weeds;
    Kind tho'ts are the sweetest,
    Loving words the best,
    Yielding hope and comfort,
    Joy, and peace, and rest.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Jesus has a garden,
    Fill'd with children sweet;
    We would be among them,
    Bowing at his feet,
    Drinking in life's waters,
    Growing by his grace,
    Like the flowers, looking
    Up into his face.  [Chorus]
