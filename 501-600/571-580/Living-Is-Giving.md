    1.
    Give!  said the golden sun:
    Up rose the mist,
    Safe in the silver clouds
    Cradled and kissed.
    Give!  said the thirsty earth:
    Down came the show'r;
    Give!  said the raindrops bright,
    Up sprang the flow'r.

    Chorus:
    Living is giving, giving is living;
    All things would die if only receiving.
    Give!  this is the rule of love by which we live.

    2.
    Give!  said the little stream:
    Up gushed the spring,
    In shady forest nook,
    Where robins sing.
    Give!  said the river wide:
    Brooks hurried down.
    Give!  said the ocean tide:
    Rivers flowed on.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Give!  said the midnight moon:
    Swift came the light
    Borrowed from far-off sun,
    Cheering the night.
    Help!  said the "Milky Way:"
    Stars heard the call,
    Orion, Pleiades, 
    Dipper and all.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Give!  cried a sinful world:
    Down came the Lord,
    He who made everything
    Just by his word.
    Give!  cries the heathen child,
    Hungry for love:
    Yes!  say our pennies bright,
    Lent from above.  [Chorus]
