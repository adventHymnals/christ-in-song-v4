    1.
    Hear the pennies dropping!
    Listen while they fall;
    Ev'ry one for Jesus,
    He will get them all,

    Refrain:
    Dropping, dropping, dropping, dropping;
    Hear the pennies fall!
    Ev'ry one for Jesus,
    He will get them all.

    2.
    Dropping, dropping ever.
    From each little hand;
    'Tis our gift to Jesus,
    From his little band.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Now, while we are little.
    Pennies are are store;
    But, when we are older,
    Lord, we'll give thee more.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Tho, we've little money.
    We can give him love;
    He will own our off'ring,
    Smiling from above.  [Refrain]
