    1.
    Gladly, gladly, toiling for the Master,
    Go we forth with willing hands to do
    Whatsoe'er to us he hath appointed,
    Faithfully our mission we'll pursue.

    Refrain:
    Toiling for Jesus,
    Joyfully we go, joyfully we go
    Toiling for Jesus,
    In his vineyard here below.

    2.
    Joyful, joyful, we will tell the story
    Of his love to mortals here below;
    Christ, the brightness of the Father's glory,
    Freely here his blessing will bestow.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Meekly, meekly, following the Master,
    Walking faithfully the path he trod;
    Leading wand'rers to the dear Redeemer,
    Pointing sinners to the Lamb of God.  [Refrain]
