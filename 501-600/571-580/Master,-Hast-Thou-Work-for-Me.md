    1.
    Master, hast thou work for me?
    I would gladly toil for thee;
    I have neither strength nor skill,
    Yet some place I long to fill;

    Refrain:
    Tho' my hands are small and weak,
    Yet some little task I seek.
    Master, hast thou work for me?
    I would gladly toil for thee.

    2.
    Let me learn in early youth,
    Lessons from thy Book of truth;
    Let me seek to walk thy ways,
    Know thy will and sing thy praise;  

    Refrain: 
    Heart and hands to thee I bring,
    Let me serve thee, holy King!
    Master, hast thou work for me?  
    I would gladly toil for thee.

    3.
    Let me daily sow some seed,
    Daily do some kindly deed;
    Grant thy loving help to me,
    Give me perfect trust in thee;

    Refrain:
    Trusting thee to teach me how,
    Let me serve thee, here and now.
    Master, hast thou work for me?
    I would gladly toil for thee.
