    1.
    Beautiful the little hands
    That fulfill the Lord's commands;
    Beautiful the little eyes,
    Kindled with light from the skies.

    Chorus:
    Beautiful, beautiful, are the hands
    That fulfill the Lord's commands;
    Beautiful, beautiful, are the eyes,
    Kindled with light from the skies.

    2.
    All the little hands were made
    Jesus precious cause to aid;
    All the little hearts to beat 
    Warm in his service so sweet.  [Chorus]

    3.
    All the little lips should pray
    To the Saviour ev'ry day;
    All the little feet should go
    Swift on his errands below.  [Chorus]

    4.
    What your little hands can do,
    That the Lord intends for you;
    Make that thing your first delight,
    Do it for him with your might.  [Chorus]
