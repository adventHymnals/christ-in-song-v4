    1.
    If I were a sunbeam,
    This is what I'd do,
    I'd find the dark places,
    Searching the forest through;
    I would kiss the pale flowers,
    Bending low at my feet,
    Till each lonely blossom
    Open'd fair and sweet.

    Chorus:
    Beautiful sunbeam!
    God sent you here;
    I'll be a sunbeam,
    Lonely hearts to cheer.

    2.
    So many dark places
    In this world of sin,
    Why not be a sunbeam,
    Letting the love light in,
    God's beautiful love light,
    Smiles and words of cheer;
    Kindness is the sunshine
    We should scatter here.  [Chorus]

    3.
    If we are like Jesus
    Sun of Righteousness
    Who left the bright mansions,
    Lonely lives to bless,
    'Twill be sweetest pleasure
    Of his love to tell,
    Shining out his gladness
    Where the sad ones dwell.  [Chorus]
