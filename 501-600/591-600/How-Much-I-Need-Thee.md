    1.
    Blessed Lord, how much I need thee!
    Weak and sinful, poor and blind;
    Take my trembling hand and lead me,
    Strength and sight in thee I find.

    Refrain:
    Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
    Blessed Lord, how much I need thee!
    Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
    Saviour, keep me ev'ry hour.

    2.
    Clothe me with thy robe of meekness,
    Stained with sin this robe of mine;
    Teach me first to feel my weakness,
    Then to plead for strength divine.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Safe am I if thou dost guide me;
    Trusting self, how seen I fall!
    Walk life's rugged way be side me,
    Thou, my light, my life, my all.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Then what e'er the future bringeth,
    Smiles of joy or tears of grief,
    Still to thee my spirit clingeth,
    Thou art still my soul's relief.  [Refrain]
