    1.
    Ready to suffer grief or pain,
    Ready to stand the test;
    Ready to stay at home and send
    Others if He sees best.

    Chorus:
    Ready to go, ready to stay,
    Ready my place to fill;
    Ready for service, lowly or great,
    Ready to do His will.

    2.
    Ready to go, ready to bear,
    Ready to watch and pray;
    Ready to stand aside and give,
    Till He shall clear the way.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Ready to speak, ready to think,
    Ready with heart and brain;
    Ready to work where He sees fit,
    Ready to bear the strain.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Ready to speak, ready to warn,
    Ready o'er souls to yearn;
    Ready in life, ready in death,
    Ready for His return.  [Chorus]
