    1.
    Give of your best to the Master,
    Give of the strength of your youth;
    Throw your soul's fresh, glowing ardor
    Into the battle for truth.
    Jesus has set the example,
    Dauntless was He, young and brave;
    Give Him your loyal devotion,
    Give Him the best that you have.  
    Give of your best to the Master;
    Give of the strength of your youth,
    Clad in salvation's full armor,
    Join in the battle for truth.

    2.
    Give of your best to the Master,
    Give Him first place in your heart;
    Give Him first place in your service,
    Consecrate now ev'ry part.
    Give and to you shall be given;
    God His beloved Son gave;
    Gratefully seeking to serve Him,
    Give Him the best that you have.
    Give of your best to the Master;
    Give of the strength of your youth,
    Clad in salvation's full armor,
    Join in the battle for truth.

    3.
    Give of your best to the Master,
    Naught else is worthy His love;
    He gave Himself for your ransom,
    Gave up His glory above;
    Laid down His life without murmur,
    You from sin's ruin to save;
    Give Him your heart's adoration,
    Give Him the best that you have.
    Give of your best to the Master;
    Give of the strength of your youth,
    Clad in salvation's full armor,
    Join in the battle for truth.
