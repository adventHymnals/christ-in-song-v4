    1.
    Buy up the opportunity,
    O Christian, buy today;
    For Heaven's ageless mansions buy,
    Buy treasures while you may.

    Chorus:
    Buy up the opportunity,
    The souls for when Christ died,
    Buy up the opportunity,
    Buy for the Crucified.

    2.
    Buy up the opportunity,
    It may not long remain;
    The evil hosts are bidding, too,
    Those precious souls to gain.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Buy up the opportunity,
    Pay any price to win;
    With Heaven's legions watching you,
    To falter will be sin.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Buy up the opportunity,
    At home; in lands afar;
    Go quickly!  Find the jewels rare,
    Each soul a glowing star.  [Chorus]
