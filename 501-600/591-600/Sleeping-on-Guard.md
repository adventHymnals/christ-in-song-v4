    1.
    Out from the campfire's red glowing,
    Cheerfully shedding the light,
    Onto the pickets we're going,
    For the long watches of night;
    Let us be careful that slumber
    Press not our eyelids too hard,
    Surely not one of our number
    Must be found sleeping on guard.

    Chorus:
    Sleeping on guard, sleeping on guard;
    No!  Surely not one of our number
    Must be found sleeping on guard.

    2.
    Yonder Rum's camp lights are burning,
    Hark is the revelry there!
    Waiting the conflict's returning,
    Scouts are abroad ev'rywhere;
    We must be watchful and ready,
    See ev'ry entrance is barred,
    Keeping our heads cool and steady;
    All is lost sleeping on guard.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Our aim is vigilance ever,
    We can allow no defeat;
    True hearted soldiers will never
    Join in the coward's retreat;
    Wary and watchful be keeping
    Tho' the task be e'er so hard,
    Knowing what dangers come creeping
    When we are sleeping on guard.  [Chorus]
