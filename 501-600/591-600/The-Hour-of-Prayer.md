[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1adxtjbHg8767FuqprtNs9A3GUzRNh2Gt/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    My God, is any hour so sweet,
    From blush of morn to evening star,
    As that which calls me to Thy feet,
    The hour of pray'r?

    2.
    No words can tell what sweet relief
    Here for my ev'ry want I find;
    What strength for warfare, balm for grief,
    What peace of mind.

    3.
    Hush'd is each doubt, gone evry fear;
    My spirit seems in heav'n to stay;
    And e'en the penitential tear
    Is wiped away.

    4.
    Lord, till I reach that blissful shore,
    No privilege so dear shall be
    As thus my inmost soul to pour
    In pray'r to Thee.
