    1.
    Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"
    Kept, by the pow'r of God;
    Kept, from the world unspotted,
    Treading where Jesus trod.

    Refrain:
    Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"
    Lord at Thy feet I fall;
    I would be "nothing, nothing, nothing;"
    Thou shalt be "all in all."

    2.
    Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"
    Serving as He shall choose;
    "Kept" for the Master's pleasure;
    "Kept" for the Master's use.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"
    Kept from the world apart;
    Lowly in mind and spirit,
    Gentle and pure in heart.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"
    Oh, to be all His own!
    Kept, to be His forever,
    Kept to be His alone!  [Refrain]
