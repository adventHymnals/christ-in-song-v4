    1.
    Now to heav'n our pray'r ascending,
    God speed the right!
    In a noble cause contending,
    God speed the right!
    Be our zeal in heav'n recorded,
    With success on earth rewarded,
    God speed the right,
    God speed the right!

    2.
    Be that prayer again repeated,
    God speed the right!
    Ne'er despairing though defeated,
    God speed the right!
    Like the good and great in story,
    If we fail, we fail with glory;
    God speed the right!

    3.
    Patient, firm, and persevering,
    God speed the right!
    No event nor danger fearing,
    God speed the right!
    Pain, nor toil, nor trial heeding,
    And in His own time succeeding;
    God speed the right!

    4.
    Still our onward course pursuing,
    God speed the right!
    Every foe at length subduing,
    God speed the right!
    Truth, our cause, whate'er delay it,
    There's no power on earth can stay it,
    God speed the right!
