    1.
    Closer to thee, my Father, draw me,
    I long for thine embrace;
    Closer within thine arms enfold me,
    I seek a resting place.

    Chorus:
    Closer with the cords of love,
    Draw me to thyself above;
    Closer draw me, 
    To thyself above.

    2.
    Closer to thee, my Saviour, draw me,
    Nor let me leave thee more;
    Fain would I feel thine arms around me,
    And count my wand'rings o'er.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Closer by thy sweet Spirit draw me,
    Till I am all like thee;
    Quicken, refine, and wash and cleanse me,
    Till I am pure and free.  [Chorus]
