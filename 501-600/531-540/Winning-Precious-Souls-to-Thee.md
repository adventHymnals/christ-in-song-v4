    1.
    Be with us, Lord, as forth we go,
    Winning precious souls to Thee;
    And make our love and zeal to glow,
    Winning precious souls to Thee.

    Chorus:
    Winning precious souls, many precious souls,
    Jewels in Thy crown to be;
    Help us bring them in from the ways of sin,
    Many precious souls to Thee.

    2.
    Help us to labor faithfully,
    Winning precious souls to Thee;
    And gather many sheaves for Thee,
    Winning precious souls to Thee.  [Chorus]

    3.
    We toil with feeble hands and weak,
    Winning precious souls to thee;
    To us new faith and courage speak,
    Winning precious souls to thee.  [Chorus]

    4.
    As we each day our work pursue,
    Winning precious souls to Thee;
    Our faith increase, our zeal renew,
    Winning precious souls to Thee.  [Chorus]

    5.
    We need Thy help, O gracious Lord!
    Winning precious souls to Thee;
    Go with us, and Thy aid afford,
    Winning precious souls to Thee.  [Chorus]

    6.
    As we go forth in trust and love,
    Winning precious souls to Thee;
    Send down Thy blessing from above,
    Winning precious souls to Thee.  [Chorus]
