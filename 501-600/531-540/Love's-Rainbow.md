    1.
    Life is not a cloudless journey,
    Storms and darkness oft oppress,
    But the Father's changeless mercy,
    Comes to cheer the heart's distress;
    Heavy clouds may darkly hover,
    Hiding all faith's view above.
    But across the thickest darkness,
    Shines the rainbow of His love.

    Chorus:
    After storm the rainbow shineth
    Promise writ in light above;
    Even so across our sorrow
    Shines the rainbow of His love.

    2.
    Dark the clouds and wild the tempest;
    Turn, oh, turn thy longing eyes!
    See afar, the Father's promise,
    Out of gloom, in light arise;
    See the glowing, gleaming colors,
    Father's love to us they prove;
    He hath promised; He is faithful,
    'Tis the rainbow of His love.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Never fear, nor be discouraged,
    Tho' life's journey dark appear,
    Travel on, by faith upholden,
    "God is love" oh, tho't of cheer!
    When thy path seems hid in shadow,
    Look with fearless eyes above;
    Spanning o'er thy deepest sorrow, 
    Shines the rainbow of His love.  [Chorus]
