    1.
    Walk in the light the Lord has given
    To guide thy steps aright;
    His Holy Spirit, sent from heav'n,
    Can cheer the darkest night.

    Chorus:
    Walk in the light,
    Walk in the light
    Walk in the light,
    Walk in the light, the light of God.

    2.
    Walk in the light of gospel truth
    That shines from God's own Word,
    A light to guide in early youth
    The faithful of the Lord.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Walk in the light; tho' shadows dark
    Should fall across thy way,
    Darkness will flee before the light
    Of God's eternal day.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Walk in the light, and thou shall know
    The love of God to thee;
    The fellowship, so sweet below,
    In heav'n will sweeter be.  [Chorus]
