    1.
    "Go ye into all the world,
    And preach the gospel to ev'ry creature,"
    Let my banner be unfurled,
    With pen, and song, and the living teacher.

    Chorus:
    "Even unto the end,
    Even unto the end;"
    "Lo, I am with you alway,
    Even unto the end."

    2.
    Millions bless'd with gospel light,
    Yet need the gladness of sins forgiven;
    Millions, cursed with heathen night,
    Yet long to know of the Way to heaven.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Stand not idle all the day,
    Because no man hath declared thy wages;
    Work on, love demands no pay,
    'Tis all set down in the heav'nly pages.  [Chorus]

    4.
    All things on the altar lay,
    Let Calvry's cross be thy only glory;
    Cast all selfish fear away,
    Begin just now telling love's sweet story.  [Chorus]
