    1.
    Seeking the lost, yes, kindly entreating
    Wanderers on the mountains astray,
    "Come unto me," his message repeating,
    Words of the Master speaking today.

    Chorus:
    Going afar, afar upon the mountain,
    Bringing the wand'rers, the wand'rers back again,
    Into the fold, the fold of my Redeemer
    Jesus the Lamb, the Lamb for sinners slain.

    2.
    Seeking the lost, and pointing to Jesus
    Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore,
    Leading them forth in ways of salvation,
    Showing the path to life evermore.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Thus would I go, for Jesus hath call'd me,
    Him would I follow day unto day;
    Care for the dying, raise up the fallen,
    Pointing the lost to Jesus the way.  [Chorus]
