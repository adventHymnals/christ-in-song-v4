[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1egyP4dY4OTPykFPHP85i5365sTwAcxjp/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,
    Anywhere he leads me in this world below;
    Anywhere without him, dearest joys would fade,
    Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.

    Chorus:
    Anywhere!  anywhere! 
    Fear I cannot know;
    Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.

    2.
    Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone,
    Other friends may fail me, he is still my own;
    Tho' his hand may lead me over dreary ways,
    Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
    When the gloomy shadows round about me creep,
    Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;
    Anywhere with Jesus will be home sweet home.  [Chorus]
