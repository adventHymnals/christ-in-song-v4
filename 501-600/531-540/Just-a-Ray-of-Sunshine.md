    1.
    Just a ray of sunshine
    Breaking thro' the gloom,
    Makes the earth rejoice again,
    And the flow'rs to bloom:
    Makes the earth rejoice again
    And makes the flow'rs to bloom.

    2.
    Just a little kindness,
    Bright and sunny smile,
    Makes the sad heart sing again,
    All its cares beguile,
    Makes the sad heart sing again
    And all its cares beguile.

    3.
    Words and smiles so kindly
    Like the sunshine fall,
    Let your presence ever be
    Blessings unto all;
    Let your presence ever be
    Rich blessings unto all.
