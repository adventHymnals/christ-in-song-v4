    1.
    In the highways and hedges go seek for the lost,
    Gather them in to the fold,
    Was the earnest command that our Saviour divine
    Taught his disciples of old.

    Chorus:
    Urge them to come, show them the way;
    Tenderly, lovingly, bring them today;
    Urge them to come, why should they roam?
    Bring them along to our dear Saviour's home.

    2.
    If the Shepherd we love, we will care for the sheep;
    Precious are they in his sight;
    They are out in the desert, they wander alone;
    Lead them from darkness to light.  [Chorus]

    3.
    To the weary and thirsty the Saviour has said,
    "Come, heavy laden, to me,
    I will give you to drink of the water of life;"
    Tell them the fountain is free.  [Chorus]

    4.
    There's welcome for all in the kingdom of grace,
    All who repent and believe;
    And the souls that have stray'd and returned to the fold,
    Jesus will gladly receive.  [Chorus]
