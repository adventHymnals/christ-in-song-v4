    1.
    Would you win a Saviour's blessing?
    Freely, freely give;
    Would you see his work progressing?
    Freely, freely give;
    Let your souls with love expand,
    Open wide a liberal hand;
    Would you follow God's command?
    Freely, freely give.

    2.
    With a cheerful heart and willing,
    Freely, freely give;
    Like the dew its balm distilling,
    Freely, freely give;
    Have you little?  Give your mite;
    O how precious in his sight!
    He your off'ring will requite;
    Freely, freely give.

    3.
    Give to spread the grand Old Story,
    Freely, freely give;
    Give to speed the light of glory,
    Freely, freely give;
    Would you gain a rich reward
    In the harvest of the Lord?
    Then obedient to his word,
    Freely, freely give.
