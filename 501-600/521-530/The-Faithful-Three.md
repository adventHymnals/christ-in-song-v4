    1.
    Look upon the golden image,
    Hear the king's decree,
    See the burning fiery furnace,
    And the faithful three.

    Chorus:
    Stand for the right
    Wherever you may be,
    Trust in the Lord,
    Like the faithful three.
    We will follow their example,
    Brave and faithful three,
    Bowing not before the image
    At the world's decree.

    2.
    'Twas a heathen king's commandment
    Governed conscience then,
    Yet how bravely for Jehovah
    Stood those noble men!  [Chorus]

    3.
    So when earthly creeds of error
    Bid you bend the knee,
    Turn and read the simple story
    Of the faithful three.  [Chorus]

    4.
    God is able to deliver
    As in days of old,
    All who walk the path of duty,
    Fearless, firm, and bold.  [Chorus]
