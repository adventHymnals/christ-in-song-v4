    1.
    Father, we come to thee,
    No other help have we,
    Thou wilt our refuge be,
    On thee we call;
    Earth is but dark and drear
    Without thy presence near;
    Be thou our comfort here,
    Father of all.

    Chorus:
    Father, we come to thee,
    Turn not away;
    Helpless we come to thee,
    Hear while we pray.

    2.
    Save from our many foes,
    Save from our earthly woes,
    Be thou our soul's repose
    In time of need;
    Fearful are we and weak,
    To us sweet courage speak;
    Thy mighty arm we seek
    For strength indeed.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Give us by grace divine,
    Seal us forever thine,
    Our wayward feet incline
    From sin to flee.
    O guide us we implore,
    'Till weary life is o'er,
    And on a brighter shore 
    We dwell with thee.  [Chorus]
