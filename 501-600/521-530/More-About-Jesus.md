    1.
    More about Jesus I would know,
    More of His grace to others show;
    More of His saving fullness see,
    More of His love who died for me.

    Refrain:
    More, more about Jesus,
    More, more about Jesus;
    More of His saving fullness see,
    More of His love who died for me.

    2.
    More about Jesus let me learn,
    More of His holy will discern;
    Spirit of God, my teacher be,
    Showing the things of Christ to me.  [Refrain]

    3.
    More about Jesus; in His word
    Holding communion with my Lord,
    Hearing His voice in ev'ry line,
    Making each faithful saying mine.  [Refrain]

    4.
    More about Jesus; on His throne,
    Riches in glory all His own;
    More of His kingdom's sure increase;
    More of His coming, Prince of Peace.  [Refrain]
