    1.
    Saviour, lead me lest I stray,
    Gently lead me all the way;
    I am safe when by thy side,
    I would in thy love abide.
    Lead me, Lead me, 
    Saviour, lead me, lest I stray;
    Gently down the stream of time,
    Lead me, Saviour, all the way.

    2.
    Thou the refuge of my soul,
    When life's stormy billows roll;
    I am safe when thou art nigh,
    All my hopes on thee rely.
    Lead me, Lead me, 
    Saviour, lead me, lest I stray;
    Gently down the stream of time,
    Lead me, Saviour, all the way.

    3.
    Saviour, lead me till at last,
    When the storm of life is past,
    I shall reach the land of day,
    Where all tears are wiped away.
    Lead me, Lead me, 
    Saviour, lead me, lest I stray;
    Gently down the stream of time,
    Lead me, Saviour, all the way.
