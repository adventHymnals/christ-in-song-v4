    1.
    Is there anyone can help us, one who understands our hearts
    When the thorns of life have pierced them till they bleed;
    One who sympathizes with us, who in wondrous love imparts
    Just the very, very blessing that we need?

    Chorus:
    Yes, there's One, only One,
    The blessed, blessed Jesus, He's the One;
    When afflictions press the soul, when waves of trouble roll,
    And you need a friend to help you, He's the One.

    2.
    Is there anyone can help us when the load is hard to bear,
    And we faint and fall beneath it in alarm;
    Who in tenderness will lift us, and the heavy burden share,
    And support us with an everlasting arm?  [Chorus]

    3.
    Is there anyone can help us, who can give a sinner peace
    When His heart is burden'd down with pain and woe;
    Who can speak the word of pardon that affords sweet release,
    And whose blood can wash and makes as white as snow?  [Chorus]
