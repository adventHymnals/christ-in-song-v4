## 523.  Look For the Beautiful
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aEWPXJoCrzJRkNNX8Qd3NNnrh9QPVR7Y/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Look for the beautiful, look for the true;
    Sunshine and shadow are all around you;
    Looking at evil we grope in the night,
    Looking at Jesus we walk in the light,
    Look for the beautiful, honor the right.

    2.
    Think of the beautiful, think of the true;
    Thoughts like an avalanche sweep over you;
    Keep not the multitude, sort them with care,
    Testing by purity, purging by pray'r;
    Think of the beautiful, think of the fair.

    3.
    Talk of the beautiful, talk of the true;
    Tongues full of poison are whisp'ring to you;
    Answer them not with a talebearing word,
    Only in blessing the voice should be heard;
    Talk of the beautiful, talk of thy Lord.

    4.
    Live for the beautiful, love for the true,
    Lifting the fallen as Christ lifted you;
    Search for the jewels imbedded in sin,
    Bring them to Jesus, his blood washes clean;
    Live for the beautiful, keep love within.
