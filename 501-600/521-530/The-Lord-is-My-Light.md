    1.
    The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?
    By day and by night his presence is near;
    He is my salvation from sorrow and sin;
    This blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in.

    Chorus:
    The Lord is my light, my joy and my song;
    By day and by night he leads me along.
    The Lord is my light, my joy and my song;
    By day and by night he leads me along.

    2.
    The Lord is my light; tho' clouds may arise,
    Faith stronger than sight, looks up to the skies
    Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign;
    Then how can I ever in darkness remain?  [Chorus]

    3.
    The Lord is my light, the Lord is my strength,
    I know in his might I'll conquer at length;
    My weakness in mercy he covers with pow'r,
    And, walking by faith, he upholds me each hour.  [Chorus]

    4.
    The Lord is my light, my all and in all;
    There is in his sight no darkness at all;
    He is my Redeemer, my Saviour and King;
    With saints and with angels his praises I sing.  [Chorus]
