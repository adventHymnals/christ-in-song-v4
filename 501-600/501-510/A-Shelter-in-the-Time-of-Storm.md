    1.
    The Lord's our Rock, in him we hide,
    A shelter in the time of storm;
    Secure whatever may betide,
    A shelter in the time of storm.

    Chorus:
    Mighty Rock in a weary land,
    Cooling Shade on the burning sand,
    Faithful Guide for the pilgrim band,
    A shelter in the time of storm.

    2.
    A shade by day, defence by night,
    A shelter in the time of storm;
    No fears alarm, no foes affright,
    A shelter in the time of storm.  [Chorus]

    3.
    The raging floods may round us beat,
    A shelter in the time of storm;
    We find in God a safe retreat,
    A shelter in the time of storm.  [Chorus]

    4.
    O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,
    A shelter in the time of storm;
    Be thou our helper, ever near,
    A shelter in the time of storm.  [Chorus]
