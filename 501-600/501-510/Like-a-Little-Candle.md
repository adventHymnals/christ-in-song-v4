    1.
    Jesus bids us shine with a pure, clear light,
    Like a little candle burning in the night;
    In this world of darkness we must shine,
    You in your corner, I in mine.

    2.
    Jesus bids us shine thro' the gloom around,
    Many kinds of darkness in this world are found;
    Sin, and want, and sorrow; so we shine,
    You in your corner, I in mine.

    3.
    When we shine for others we shine for Him,
    Well He sees and knows it if our light is dim;
    He looks down from heaven, sees us shine,
    You in your corner, I in mine.

    4.
    Jesus is a bright light of love divine,
    When on Him we're looking, then it is we shine,
    Like the silver moon, with borrowed light,
    Each in his corner, doing right.
