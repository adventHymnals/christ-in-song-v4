    1.
    Sound the battle cry, 
    See!  the foe is nigh;
    Raise the standard high  
    For the Lord;
    Gird your armor on, 
    Stand firm, ev'ry one,
    Rest your cause upon 
    His holy word.

    Chorus:
    Rouse, then soldiers!  rally round the banner!
    Ready, steady, pass the word along;
    Onward, forward, shout a loud Hosanna!
    Christ is Captain of the faithful throng.

    2.
    Strong to meet the foe, 
    Marching on we go,
    While our cause we know  
    Must prevail;
    Shield and banner bright, 
    Gleaming in the light,
    Battling for the right, 
    We ne'er can fail.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O thou God of all, 
    Hear us when we call, 
    Help us, one and all, 
    By thy grace;
    When the battle's done,
    And the vict'ry won,
    May we wear the crown  
    Before thy face.  [Chorus]
