    1.
    Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
    He'll help you along, help you along;
    If you will trust His love unfailing,
    He'll fill your heart with song.

    Chorus:
    Lean on His arms, trusting in His love;
    Lean on His arms, all His mercies prove;
    Lean on His arms, looking home above,
    Just lean on the Saviour's arms!

    2.
    Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
    He'll brighten the way, brighten the way;
    Just follow gladly where He leadeth,
    His gentle voice obey.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
    O bring ev'ry care, bring ev'ry care!
    The burden that has seemed so heavy,
    Take it to the Lord in pray'r.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
    Then leave all to Him, leave all to Him;
    His heart is full of love and mercy,
    His eyes are never dim.  [Chorus]
