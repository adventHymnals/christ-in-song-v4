    1.
    Under His wings I am safely abiding;
    Tho' the night deepens and tempests are wild,
    Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;
    He has redeemed me, and I am His child.

    Chorus:
    Under His wings, under His wings,
    Who from His love can sever?
    Under His wings my soul shall abide,
    Safely abide forever.

    2.
    Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!
    How the heart yearningly turns to its rest!
    Often when earth has no balm for my healing,
    There I find comfort, and there I am blest.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment!
    There will I hide till life's trials are o'er;
    Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;
    Resting in Jesus I'm safe ever more.  [Chorus]
