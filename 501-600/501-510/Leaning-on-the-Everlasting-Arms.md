    1.
    What a fellowship, what a joy divine,
    Leaning on the everlasting arms;
    What a blessedness, what a peace is mine,
    Leaning on the everlasting arms.

    Refrain:
    Leaning, leaning,
    Safe and secure from all alarms,
    Leaning, leaning,
    Leaning on the everlasting arms.

    2.
    O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,
    Leaning on the everlasting arms;
    O how bright the path grows from day to day
    Leaning on the everlasting arms.  [Refrain]

    3.
    What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
    Leaning on the everlasting arms?
    I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,
    Leaning on the everlasting arms.  [Refrain]
