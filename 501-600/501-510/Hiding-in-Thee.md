    1.
    O safe to the Rock that is higher than I,
    My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;
    So sinful, so weary, Thine, thine would I be;
    Thou blest "Rock of Ages," I'm hiding in Thee.

    Chorus:
    Hiding in Thee,
    Hiding in Thee, 
    Thou blest "Rock of Ages,"
    I'm hiding in Thee.

    2.
    In the calm of the noon tide, in sorrow's lone hour,
    In times when temptation casts o'er me its power;
    In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea;
    Thou blest "Rock of Ages," I'm hiding in Thee.  [Chorus]

    3.
    How oft in the conflict, when press'd by the foe,
    I have fled to my Refuge and breath'd out my woe;
    How often, when trials like sea billows roll,
    Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.  [Chorus]
