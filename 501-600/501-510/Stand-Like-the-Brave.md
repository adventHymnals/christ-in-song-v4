    1.
    O Christian, awake!  'tis the Master's command;
    With helmet and shield, and a sword in thy hand,
    To meet the bold tempter, go, fearlessly go,
    And stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

    Chorus:
    Stand like the brave, stand like the brave,
    Stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
