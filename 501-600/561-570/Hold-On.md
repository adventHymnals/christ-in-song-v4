    1.
    If your hand's on the plow, hold on, hold on;
    Tho' the soil may be sterile and hard,
    The plowshare will make
    The fallow ground break,
    And the plowman will have his reward;
    Earth's bosom will sparkle with emerald green,
    And its grain will be golden king;
    The reapers will come, with loud "Harvest Home."
    And the gleaners will joyfully sing.

    Chorus:
    Hold on, hold on, my brother, hold on,
    Hold on till the prize is won;
    Hold on to the plow,
    And weary not now,
    For the work is almost done.

    2.
    If your heart's in the work, hold on, hold on;
    Tho' the way should be gloomy and sad,
    A light will appear,
    The pathway be clear,
    And the heart of the worker be glad;
    Heav'n's portals will open, and music resound,
    And the mansions of bliss will ring
    With praise for the brave, who labor to save,
    And the angels will joyfully sing.  [Chorus]
