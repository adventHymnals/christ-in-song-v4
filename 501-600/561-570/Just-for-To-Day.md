    1.
    Lord, for tomorrow and its needs,
    I do not pray;
    Keep me from ev'ry stain of sin
    Just for today;
    Let me no wrong or idle word
    Unthinking say;
    Set Thou a seal upon my lips,
    Just for to-day.

    2.
    I would both diligently work
    And duly pray;
    I would be kind in word and deed
    Just for to-day;
    O make me strong to do Thy will,
    Swift to obey,
    Willing to sacrifice myself,
    Just for to-day.  

    3.
    And if to-day this life of mine
    Should ebb away,
    O may Thy promises divine,
    Still be my stay.
    So for tomorrow and its needs I do not pray;
    O keep me, guide me, hold me, Lord,
    Just for to-day.  Amen.
