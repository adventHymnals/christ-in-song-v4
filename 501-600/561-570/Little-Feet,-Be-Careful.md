    1.
    I wash'd my hands this morning,
    O very clean and white,
    And lent them both to Jesus,
    To work for him till night.

    Chorus:
    Little feet, be careful,
    Where you take me to,
    Anything for Jesus,
    Only let me do.

    2.
    I told my ears to listen
    Quite closely all day thro',
    For any act of kindness,
    Such little hands can do.  [Chorus]

    3.
    My eyes are set to watch them
    About their work or play,
    To keep them out of mischief,
    For Jesus' sake all day.  [Chorus]
