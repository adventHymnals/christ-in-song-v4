[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yw1rTFY%2DTRtWctouHtuFX7bHeiDRB%2DSg/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    What shall I do with Jesus?
    He stands before me now,
    Wearing the robe of purple,
    And thorns upon His brow.

    Refrain:
    This is the question now;
    What shall the answer be?
    Shall I crucify King Jesus,
    And set Barabbas free?

    2.
    Shall I release the robber,
    The carnal man of pride?
    Sin or a sinless Saviour?--
    O which shall be denied?

    Refrain:
    This is the question now;
    What shall the answer be?
    Shall I crucify King Jesus,
    And set Barabbas free?

    3.
    Solemn and awful question!  
    How still the balance stands!
    Mercy a moment lingers,
    It trembles in her hands.

    Refrain:
    This is the question now;
    What shall the answer be?
    Shall I crucify King Jesus,
    And set Barabbas free?

    4.
    Self on the seat of judgment,
    Dare you the world deny?
    Louder and louder calling,
    "Away!"  and "Crucify!"

    Refrain:
    This is the question now;
    What shall the answer be?
    Shall I crucify King Jesus,
    And set Barabbas free?

    5.
    Not to the sinner only,
    The question comes with pow'r;
    Hear it, ye halting Christians,
    In ev'ry trial hour.

    Refrain:
    This is the question now;
    What shall the answer be?
    I will crucify Barabbas,
    And set King Jesus free.
 
 

## 2.  White Leaves
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YyxFCehKgWkQuP1e8iAr7urQ5OF46Vpz/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    White pages before us, thank God this is so;
    Past errors forgiven, wash'd whiter than snow;
    O'er sin-blotted record why sorrowing more?
    Confess to the Father, white leaves are before.

    Chorus:
    Beautiful leaves from heav'n,
    Moments in mercy giv'n,
    New days of trial for him who grieves;
    One more probation hour,
    Promise of holy pow'r.
    What shall be written on life's new leaves?
    What shall be written on our white leaves?

    2.
    Forgiven, forgotten, Christ covers from view,
    And strength for the future, gives daily anew;
    All offers He freely for thy sinful heart:
    This, this must be yielded, all, all, not a part.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Despondent one wounded by treacherous foe,
    In moment unguarded by sin smitten low;
    Defeated; yet never surrender Christ's name,
    Take courage and speak it, deliverance claim.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Then faithful in service, from hour unto hour,
    By full consecration draw fulness of pow'r;
    His oil of love burning gives out the true light,
    The life to Him yielded hath pages of white.  [Chorus]

    Wilt thou farther roam?
    Come, and all is pardoned,
    My son!  my son!  [Chorus]

    6.
    "See the well-spread table,
    Unforgotten one!
    Here is rest and plenty,
    My son!  my son!  [Chorus]

    7.
    "Thou art friendless, homeless,
    Hopeless, and undone;
    Mine is love unchanging,
    My son!  my son!"  [Chorus]

    Drifting away from the Saviour,
    Casting reproach on the Lord;

    Drifting away, drifting away,
    Drifting away from the Saviour,
    Drifting, still drifting away.

    He is preparing above.  [Refrain]

    Lonely and helpless thou art;
    Drifting away from His people,

    He who has showed you the way;
    Drifting away from His teaching,

    1.
    Some one will enter the pearly gate
    By and by, by and by,
    Taste of the glories that there await,
    Shall you?  shall I?  Shall you?  shall I?
    Some one will travel the streets of gold,
    Beautiful visions will there behold,
    Feast on the pleasures so long foretold:
    Shall you?  shall I?  Shall you?  shall I?

    2.
    Some one will gladly his cross lay down
    By and by, by and by,

    Ever from sorrow of earth be free,
    Happy with Him thro' eternity:

    Some one will knock when the door is shut
    By and by, by and by,
    Hear a voice saying, "I know you not,"
    Shall you?  shall I?  Shall you?  shall I?
    Some one will call and shall not be heard,
    Vainly will strive when the door is barred,
    Someone will fail of the saints reward:
    Shall you?  shall I?  Shall you?  shall I?

    4.
    Some one will sing the triumphant song
    By and by, by and by,
    Join in the praise with the blood-bought throng
    Shall you?  shall I?  Shall you?  shall I?
    Some one will greet on the golden shore,
    Loved ones of earth, pain and parting o'er,
    Safe in the glory for evermore:
    Shall you?  shall I?  Shall you?  shall I?

    1.
    There was One who was willing to die in my stead,
    That a soul, so unworthy, might live,
    And the path to the cross He was willing to tread,
    All the sins of my life to forgive.

    Refrain:
    They are nailed to the cross,
    They are nailed to the cross,
    O how much He was willing to bear!
    With what anguish and loss,
    Jesus went to the cross!
    And He carried my sins with Him there.

    2.
    He is tender and loving and patient with me,
    While He cleanses my heart of its dross,
    But "there's no condemnation" I know I am free,
    For my sins are all nailed to the cross.  [Refrain]

    3.
    I will cling to my Saviour and never depart
    I will joyfully journey each day,
    With a song on my lips and a song in my heart,
    That my sins have been taken away.  [Refrain]

    O tender and sweet was the Father's voice,
    As he lovingly called to me,
    "Come over the line, it is only a step,
    I'm waiting, my child, for thee." 

    Chorus:
    "Over the line," hear the sweet refrain,
    Angels are chanting the heavenly strain;
    "Over the line," Why should I remain
    With a step between me and Jesus?

    2.
    "But my sins are so many, my faith so small,"
    Lo!  the answer came quick and clear,
    "Thou needest not trust in thyself at all,
    Step over the line, I'm here."  [Chorus]

    3.
    "But my flesh is so feeble," with tears I said,
    "And the pathway I cannot see;
    I fear if I try I may sadly fail,
    And thus dishonor thee."  [Chorus]

    4.
    The world is so cold I cannot go back,
    Press forward I surely must:
    I'll lay my weak hand in his wounded palm.
    Step over the line and trust.  [Chorus]

    1.
    Like wand'ring sheep o'er mountains cold,
    Since all have gone astray;
    To "Life" and peace within the fold,
    How may I find the way?

    No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.

    I am the way, the truth, and the life;
    No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

    2.
    Bewildered oft with doubt and care,

    While many cry "Lo here!  lo there!"
    The Truth how may I know?  [Chorus]

    3.
    To Christ the Way, the Truth, the Life,
    I come, no more to roam;

    To my eternal home.  [Chorus]
 
 

## 11.  Only Two Ways
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X6PGmU6YkEe2LzvpxrFO%2DuDXtp4wR3QM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There are two ways for trav'lers, only two ways:
    One's a hill pathway of battle and praise;
    The other leads downward; tho flow'ry it seem
    Its joy is a phantom, its love is a dream
    Its love is a dream, 'tis only a dream.

    2.
    There are two guides for trav'lers, only two guides:
    One's the Good Shepherd, e'en thro' the death tides;
    The other, the serpent, beguiling with sin
    Whose beauty external hides poison within,
    Hides poison within, death poison within.

    3.
    There are two homes for trav'lers, only two homes:
    One's the fair city where evil ne'er comes;
    The other, sin's wages, eternal and dread,
    The fate of the lost ones, the doom of the dead.
    The doom of the dead, the sorrowful dead.

    4.
    Quickly enter the strait way, leading to life;
    Shun the wide gateway of folly and strife.
    The Spirit invites you this moment to come;
    The Saviour is waiting to welcome you home;
    To welcome you home, to welcome you home.

    Chorus:
    "Whosoever will, whosoever will,"
    Send the proclamation over vale and hill;
    'Tis a loving Father calls the wand'rer home:
    "Whosoever will, may come."

    2.
    Whosoever cometh need not delay,
    Now the door is open, enter while you may;
    Jesus is the true, the only Living Way:
    "Whosoever will, may come."  [Chorus]

    3.
    "Whosoever will," the promise secure,
    "Whosoever will," for ever must endure;
    "Whosoever will," 'Tis life for evermore:
    "Whosoever will, may come."  [Chorus]

    Room, room, 
    yet there is room;
    Come, come, 
    come while there's room.

    2.
    Daylight declines, 
    The sun is sinking low;
    The shadows lengthen,
    light makes haste to go:  [Refrain]

    3.
    The bridal hall 
    is filling for the feast:
    Pass in!  pass in! 
    and be the Bridegroom's guest;  [Refrain]

    that hall of jubilee!
    Make haste, make haste; 
    'tis not too full for thee:  [Refrain]

    Still open stands the gate,
    The gate of love;
    it is not yet too late:  [Refrain]

    Pass in, pass in!  
    That banquet is for thee;
    That cup of everlasting 
    love is free:  [Refrain]

    7.
    All heaven is there,
    all joy!  Go in, go in;
    The angels beckon thee
    the prize to win:  [Refrain]

    8.
    Soon night will close that gate
    and seal thy doom:
    Then the sad cry,
    "No more for me, no room!'  [Refrain]

    Who have a place in the soul's bright home?"

    Chorus:
    Sound the alarm, watchman,
    Sound the alarm!
    For the Lord will come with a conqu'ring arm;
    And the hosts of sin, as their ranks advance,
    Shall wither and fall at His glance.

    2.
    Sound the alarm!  let the cry go forth,
    Swift as the wind, o'er the realms of earth;
    Flee to the Rock where the soul may hide!
    Flee to the Rock!  in its cleft abide.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Sound the alarm on the mountain's brow!
    Plead with the lost by the wayside now;
    Warn them to come and the truth embrace;
    Urge them to come and be saved by grace.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Sound the alarm in the youthful ear,
    Sound it aloud that the old may hear;
    Blow ye the trump while the day beams last!
    Blow ye the trump till the light is past!  [Chorus]
 
 

## 15.  Get Right with God

    1.
    In darkness I lingered 'mid doubt and despair,
    Sin's bondage long held me a captive to care;
    But Jesus delivered my soul from its chains,
    His precious blood cleans'd me from sin's guilty stains.

    Chorus:
    Get right with God!
    His pardon is free,
    Get right with God,
    He's waiting for thee;
    Our Jesus is calling, "Oh, come unto me!"
    Take Him, O sinner, and get right with God.

    2.
    The world and its pleasures did tempt me to stray,
    I saw not the danger that lurk'd on the way;
    The toils clos'd around me, I knew no release,
    But Jesus has found me and giv'n me His peace.  [Chorus]

    3.
    The pathway to Calv'ry is toilsome and hard,
    Yet tread it, O faint me, and find thy reward;
    Here lay down thy burden, and wash in the stream
    That flows like a fountain thy soul to redeem.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Repent while He calls thee, while yet it is day,
    Take with thee His gift of free pardon away;
    Take Christ for thy Saviour, Redeemer, and Friend, His love will sustain thee secure to the end.  [Chorus]

    O heart bowed down with sorrow!
    O eyes that long for sight!
    There's gladness in believing;
    In Jesus there is light.

    Refrain:
    "Come unto me, all ye that labor, 
    and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
    Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;
    for I am meek and lowly in heart:
    and ye shall find rest unto your souls."

    2.
    Earth's fleeting gain and pleasure
    Can never satisfy;
    'Tis love our joy doth measure,
    For love can never die.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Divinest consolation
    Doth Christ the Healer give;
    Art thou in condemnation?
    Repent, believe and live.  [Refrain]

    4.
    His peace is like a river,
    His love is like a song;
    His yoke's a burden never;
    'Tis easy all day long.  [Refrain]

    2.
    If clearer vision thou impart,
    Grateful and glad my soul shall be;
    But yet to have a purer heart,
    Is more to me, Is more to me.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Yea, only as this heart is clean
    May larger vision yet be mine,
    For mirrored in Thy life are seen
    The things divine, The things divine.  [Refrain]

    4.
    I watch to shun the miry way,
    And stanch the springs of guilty thought,
    But watch and struggle as I may,
    Pure I am not, Pure I am not.  [Refrain]
 
 

## 20.  'Shall I Let Him In?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XU8GH3iBCDx1xZbQ19Qzt3FOsw6zS1aO/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Christ is knocking at my sad heart;
    Shall I let him in?
    Patiently pleading with my sad heart;
    O shall I let him in?
    Cold and proud is my heart with sin,
    Dark and cheerless is all within;
    Christ is bidding me turn unto him;
    O shall I let him in?

    2.
    Shall I send him the loving word?
    Shall I let him in?
    Meekly accepting my gracious Lord,
    O shall I let him in?
    He can infinite love impart,
    He can pardon this rebel heart;
    Shall I bid him forever depart,
    Or shall I let him in?

    3.
    Yes, I'll open this heart's proud decor,
    Yes, I'll let him in.
    Gladly I'll welcome him evermore;
    O, yes, I'll let him in.
    Blessed Saviour, abide with me,
    Cares and trials will lighter be;
    I am safe if I'm only with thee,
    O, blessed Lord, come in!
 
 

## 21.  Let Him In
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ao8yPlskh1kAEsQTfHsfu7V1ek9tHV3e/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There's a Stranger at the door, 
    Let him in;
    He has been there oft before, 
    Let him in;
    Let him in, ere he is gone,
    Let him in, the Holy One,
    Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, 
    Let him in.

    2.
    Open now to him your heart,
    Let him in;
    If you wait he will depart,
    Let him in;
    Let him in, he is your friend,
    And your soul he will defend;
    He will keep you to the end, 
    Let him in.

    3.
    Hear you now his pleading voice?
    Let him in;
    Now, O now make him your choice,
    Let him in.
    He is standing at the door,
    Joy to you he will restore,
    And his name you will adore,
    Let him in.

    4.
    Now admit the heav'nly guest,
    Let him in:
    He will make for you a feast,
    Let him in;
    He will speak your sins forgiv'n,
    And when earth ties all are riv'n,
    He will take your home to heav'n,
    Let him in.
 
 

## 22.  'Would You Believe?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bJehnB9lCPu9I0Kd%2DGZVBOH6Mi0625hd/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    If you could see Christ standing here tonight,
    His thorn-crown'd head and pierced hands could view;
    Could see those eyes that beam with heavn's own light,
    And hear Him say, "Beloved, 'twas for you:"

    Chorus:
    Would you believe, and Jesus receive,
    If He were standing here?
    Would you believe, and Jesus receive,
    If He were standing here?

    2.
    If you could see that face so calm and sweet,
    Those lips that spake words only pure and true;
    Could see the nail prints in His tender feet,
    And hear Him say, "Beloved, 'twas for you:"  [Chorus]

    3.
    He whispers to your heart, turn not away,
    For He's beside you, in your narrow pew;
    If you will listen, you will hear Him say 
    In loving tones "Beloved, 'twas for you."  [Chorus]
 
 

## 23.  Repeating Calvary
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ay5Yd%2D%2DiIKUUt6x28c4pjXdfvhgJsUfY/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I cannot drive the nails again,
    I cannot thrust the spear of pain,
    I cannot bear to see His grief and agony,
    Repeating Calvary 
    By tho't of sin,
    Repeating Calvary  
    By tho't of sin.

    2.
    'Twas sin alone that nailed Him there,
    'Twas love alone that made Him bear;
    Sin's wage of death, our due,
    Upon himself He drew
    That we may live anew,
    His glory share,
    That we may live anew, 
    His glory share.

    3.
    His power frees from fetters strong,
    All who confess and turn from wrong:
    He could have shunned the pain.
    Sin's pow'r would yet remain:
    Now law and pardon reign, 
    The angels' song, 
    Now law and pardon reign, 
    The angels' song.

    4.
    My soul abhors His murd'rer sin,
    No longer shall He dwell within;
    But Christ, the living law,
    Victor in holy war,
    Enthroned forevermore,
    Gives pow'r to win,
    Enthroned forevermore,
    Gives pow'r to win.

    Glorious message, clear and plain;

    Chorus:
    Wonderful word, O sweet refrain!
    Christ receives sinful men

    Grace is free!  proclaim to all
    Who the heav'nly pathway leave,
    All who linger, all who fall.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Years of sin condemn us not,
    Pure before the law we stand;
    Jesus' blood removes each spot,
    Satisfies its full demand.  [Chorus]

    4.
    He will take the sinfulest,
    Make the scarlet white and pure;
    Come, and he will give you rest;
    Trust his word, forever sure.  [Chorus]

    5.
    In Thy righteous robe to shine,
    Lord, I come, and rest forgiv'n;
    Self is love in love divine,
    Death in life, and earth in heav'n.  [Chorus]

    2.
    If 'tis for purity now that you sigh,
    Let Jesus come into your heart;
    Fountains for cleansing are flowing near by,
    Let Jesus come into your heart.  [Chorus]

    3.
    If there's a tempest your voice cannot still,
    Let Jesus come into your heart;
    If there's a void this world never can fill,
    Let Jesus come into your heart.  [Chorus]

    4.
    If friends, once trusted, have proven untrue,
    Let Jesus come into your heart;
    Find what a Friend He will be unto you.
    Let Jesus come into your heart.  [Chorus]

    5.
    If you would join the glad songs of the blest,
    Let Jesus come into your heart:
    If you would enter the mansions of rest,
    Let Jesus come into your heart.

    Chorus:
    Just now, my doubtings are o'er; 
    Just now, rejecting no more;
    Just now, I open the door,
    And Jesus comes into my heart.

    Ye must be born again,
    I verily, verily, say unto thee,

    2.
    Ye children of men, attend to the word
    So solemnly uttered by Jesus the Lord,
    And let not this message to you be in vain,
    "Ye must be born again." [Chorus]

    3.

    And sing with the ransom'd the song of the blest,
    The life everlasting if you would obtain,

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bP3TobLQVC5gKpKzgI3qWup0GUQqejob/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Blessed be the Fountain of blood,
    To a world of sinners revealed;
    Blessed be the dear Son of God;
    Only by his stripes we are healed.
    Tho' I've wandered far from his fold,
    Bringing to my heart pain and woe,
    Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
    And I shall be whiter than snow.

    Chorus:
    Whiter than the snow,
    Whiter than the snow,
    Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
    And I shall be whiter than snow.

    2.
    Thorny was the crown that he wore,
    And the cross his body o'er came;
    Grievous were the sorrows he bore,
    But he suffered thus not in vain.
    May I to the Fountain be led,
    Made to cleanse my sins here below;
    Wash me in the blood that he shed,
    And I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Father, I have wandered from thee,
    Often has my heart gone astray:
    Crimson do my sins seem to me,
    Water cannot wash them away.
    Jesus, to that Fountain of thine,
    Leaning on thy promise I go;
    Cleanse me by thy washing divine,
    And I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]

    Able to deliver!  courage, trembling one!

    We'll build on the Rock;
    We'll build on the Rock, on the solid Rock,

    Its own little place has fill'd;
    Ev'ry deed we have done, good or bad,
    Is a stone in the temple we build.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Ev'ry word that so lightly falls,
    Giving some heart joy or pain,
    Will shine in our temple wall,
    Or ever its beauty stain.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Are you building for God alone?
    Are you building in faith and love,
    A temple the Father will own,
    In the city of light above?  [Chorus]

    Ring, to ev'ry tribe and nation,
    Ring it out, ring it out,

    The grand old story of salvation.  [Chorus]

    3.
    We'll sing it in the battle for its notes are victory,
    The grand old story of salvation;

    1.
    Knocking, knocking, who is there?
    Waiting, waiting, O how fair!
    'Tis a Pilgrim, strange and kingly,
    Never such was seen before;
    Ah!  my soul, for such a wonder
    Wilt thou not undo the door?
    Wilt thou not undo the door?

    2.
    Knocking, knocking, still He's there,
    Waiting, waiting, wondrous fair;
    But the door is hard to open,
    For the weeds and ivy vine
    With their dark and clinging tendrils
    Ever round the hinges twice,
    Ever round the hinges twice.

    3.
    Knocking, knocking what!  still there?
    Waiting, waiting, grand and fair;
    Yea, the wounded hand still knocketh,
    And beneath the thorn-wreath'd hair
    Beam the patient eyes, so tender,
    Of thy Savior waiting there;
    Wilt thou keep him waiting there?
 
 

## 36.  'My Name in Mother''s Prayer'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZVTqeaeijNeOv1j%2DP4xZkOGu97QYwwh9/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    'Twas in the days of careless youth, when life was fair and bright,
    And ne'er a tear, and scarce a fear o'ercast my day and night,
    As in the quiet eventide, I pass'd her kneeling there,
    That just one word, my name, I heard my name in mother's pray'r.

    Chorus:
    My name in mother's pray'r.
    My name in mother's pray'r.
    That just one word, my name I heard.
    I heard my name in mother's pray'r.

    2.
    I thought but little of it then, tho' rev'rence touch'd my heart,
    To her whose love sought from above for me the better part;
    But when life's sterner battles came with many a subtle snare,
    Oft that one word, in thought I heard my name in mother's pray'r.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I wandered on, and heeded not God's oft repeated call
    To turn from sin, to live for Him, and trust to Him my all;
    But when at last, convinced of sin, I sank in deep despair,
    My hope awoke, when mem'ry spoke my name in mother's pray'r.  [Chorus]

    4.
    That pleading heart, that soul so tried, has gone into her rest,
    But still with me for aye shall be the mem'ry of her trust,
    And when I cross the Jordan's tide, and meet her over there,
    We'll praise the Lord, who bless'd that word, my name in mother's pray'r.  [Chorus]

    The question so solemn "Eternity!  where?"  
    The question so solemn "Eternity!  where?"

    2.
    "Eternity!  where?"  Oh!  Eternity!  where?
    With redeemed ones in glory?  or lost in despair?
    'Tis one or the other  "Eternity!  where?"
    'Tis one or the other "Eternity!  where?"

    3.
    "Eternity!  where?"  Oh!  how can you share
    The world's giddy pleasures, or heedlessly dare
    Do aught till you settle  "Eternity!  where?"
    Do aught till you settle  "Eternity!  where?"

    4.
    "Eternity!  where?"  Oh!  friend, have a care;
    Soon God will no longer His judgment forbear;
    This day may decide your "Eternity!  where?"
    This day may decide your "Eternity!  where?"

    5.
    "Eternity!  where?"  Oh!  Eternity!  where?
    Friend, sleep not, nor take in the world any share,
    Till you answer this question "Eternity!  where?"
    Till you answer this question "Eternity!  where?"

    1.
    The day is dead, and Egypt's night returning,
    Is dark and still in death's prophetic gloom.
    The world sleeps on, but Israel's lamp is burning;
    At midnight sounds the' oppressor's note of doom.

    Refrain:
    "I will pass over you, when I see the blood:"
    I will pass over you, 'tis a saving flood.
    "I will pass over you, when I see the blood,"
    The precious blood of Jesus. 

    2.
    The Lamb is slain, the Sacrifice immortal,
    Whose life received creates the soul anew;
    His blood is shed, but is it on the portal?
    O haste and see!  doth it avail for you?  [Refrain]

    3.
    Not there?  not there?  no crimson on the lintel?
    Delay!  delay!  O thou destroying One!
    Give grace?  give grace!  it must be more than mental:
    My heart!  my heart!  let there thy work be done.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Art safe, my soul!  rest not in thy salvation,
    Else thou art not like Him who came to die;
    In love go forth with mercy's invitation,

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZXfrODbAX2ig0CwKw_zyUstas6%2DID8hF/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    In the silent midnight watches,
    List thy bosom's door!
    How it knocketh, knocketh, knocketh,
    Knocketh, evermore!
    Say not 'tis thy pulses beating,
    'Tis thy heart of sin;
    'Tis thy Saviour knock, and crieth,
    "Rise and let me in!'

    2.
    Death comes down with reckless footsteps,
    To the hall and hut;
    Think you death will tarry knocking,
    When the door is shut?
    Jesus waiteth, waiteth, waiteth;
    But the door is fast;
    Grieved away thy Saviour goeth,
    Death breaks in at last.

    3.
    Vainly thou wilt stand entreating 
    Christ to let thee in,
    At the gate of mercy beating,
    Wailing for thy sin!
    Nay!  alas, O guilty sinner! 
    Hast thou then forgot?
    Jesus waited long to know thee,
    Now he knows thee not!

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zh7ErVZ8jAdPTklhqWUKVbotLnc3DbMs/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Tell me the story of Jesus,
    Write on my heart evry word,
    Tell me the story most precious.
    Sweetest that ever was heard.
    Tell how the angels, in chorus,
    Sang as they welcomed His birth,
    Glory to God in the highest,
    Peace and good tidings to earth.

    Chorus:
    Tell me the story of Jesus,
    Write on my heart ev'ry word,
    Tell me the story most precious,
    Sweetest that ever was heard.

    2.
    Fasting, alone in the desert,
    Tell of the days that He passed,
    How for our sins He was tempted,
    Yet was triumphant at last;
    Tell of the years of His labor,
    Tell of the sorrow He bore,
    He was despised and afflicted,
    Homeless, rejected and poor.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Tell of the cross where they nailed Him,
    Writhing in anguish and pain;
    Tell of the grave where they laid him,
    Tell how He liveth again;
    Love in that story so tender,
    Clearer than ever I see;
    Stay, let me weep while you whisper,
    Love paid the ransom for me.  [Chorus]

    1.
    O who is this that cometh
    From Edom's crimson plain,
    With wounded side, with garments dyed?
    O tell me now thy name.
    "I that saw thy soul's distress,
    A ransom gave;
    I that speak in righteousness,
    Mighty to save."

    Refrain:
    Mighty to save,
    Mighty to save,
    Mighty to save;
    Lord, I trust thy wondrous love,
    Mighty to save.

    2.
    O why is thine apparel
    With reeking gore all dyed,
    Like them that tread the winepress red?
    O why this bloody tide?
    I the wine-press trod alone, 
    "Neath dark'ning skies;
    Of the people there was none
    Mighty to save."  [Chorus]

    3.
    O bleeding Lamb, my Saviour!
    How could'st thou bear this shame?
    "With mercy fraught, mine own arm brought
    Salvation in my name;
    I the bloody fight have won,
    Conquer'd the grave,
    Now the year of joy has come,
    Mighty to save."  [Chorus]

    1.
    When Jesus shall gather the nations,
    Before him at last to appear,
    Then how shall we stand in the Judgment,
    When summon'd our sentence to hear?

    Chorus:
    He will gather the wheat in his garner,
    But the chaff will he scatter away;
    Then how shall we stand in the Judgment
    Of the great resurrection day?

    2.
    Shall we hear, from the lips of the Saviour,
    The words "faithful servant, well done,"
    Or trembling with tear and with anguish,
    Be banished away from his throne?  [Chorus]

    3.
    He will smile when he looks on his children,
    And sees on the ransom'd his seal;
    He will clothe them in heavenly beauty,
    As low at his footstool they kneel.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Then let us be watching and waiting,
    With lamps burning steady and bright;
    When the Bridegroom shall call to the wedding
    O may we be ready for flight!  [Chorus]

    5.
    Thus living with hearts fixed on heaven,
    In patience we wait for the time
    When the days of our pilgrimage ended,
    We'll bask in the presence divine.  [Chorus]

    1.
    Called to the feast by the King are we,
    Sitting, perhaps, where his people be;
    How will it fare, friend, with thee and me
    When the King comes in?

    Refrain:
    When the King comes in, brother,
    When the King comes in!
    How will it fare with thee and me
    When the King comes in?

    2.
    Crowns on the head where the thorns have been,
    Glorified he who once died for men;
    Splendid the vision before us then,
    When the King comes in.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Like lightning's flash will that instant show
    Things hidden long from both friend and foe;
    Just what we are will each neighbor know,
    When the King comes in.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Joyful his eye shall on each one rest
    Who is in white wedding garments dress'd;
    Ah!  well for us if we stand the test,
    When the King comes in.  [Refrain]

    5.
    Endless the sad separation then,
    Bitter the cry of deluded men,
    Awful that moment of anguish 
    when Christ the King comes in.  [Refrain]

    5.
    Lord, grant us all, we implore thee, grace,
    So to await thee, each in his place,
    That we may fear not to see thy face
    When thou comest in.  [Refrain]

    1.
    There's room for you to anchor
    Within the port of rest,
    Where tempests all are over,

    This precious promise giv'n;

    Safe in heaven!

    2.
    There's room for you to anchor;
    The ship is waiting now,
    The ship of God's preparing,
    O ask not why nor how.
    His boundless love and mercy
    No tongue can ever tell,
    If you but trust his promise,
    All is well.  [Refrain]

    3.
    The same dear friends shall meet us
    That we have loved below;
    The same sweet voices greet us 
    As in the long ago.
    Then hush!  ye murm'ring waters,
    Ye tempests, cease to blow!
    I almost hear the music 
    Soft and low.  [Refrain]

    4.
    O heaving, swelling billows,
    Bear onward to my home!
    Beyond these dreary headlands
    I see its shining dome.
    There, there my fainting spirit
    No more for rest shall sigh;
    'Tis there I hope to anchor,
    By and by.  [Refrain]

    Lingering is but folly,

    Seeking the lambs to stay;
    Jesus, the loving Shepherd,
    Calleth thee now to come
    Into the fold of safety,
    When there is rest and room.  [Chorus]

## 48.  The Handwriting on the Wall
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d2jk2cONdGgw16hWiZYm_KEQxk8%2DLaNY/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    At the feast of Belshazzar and a thousand of his lords,
    While they drank from golden vessels, as the Book of Truth records,
    In the night as they reveled in the royal palace hall,
    They were seiz'd with consternation, at the hand upon the wall.

    Chorus:
    'Tis the hand of God on the wall,
    'Tis the hand of God on the wall.
    Shall the record be "Found wanting,"
    Or shall it be "Found trusting,"
    While the hand is writing on the wall?

    2.
    See the brave captive Daniel as he stood before the throng,
    And rebuked the haughty monarch for his mighty deeds of wrong;
    As he read out the writing,'twas the doom of one and all;
    For the kingdom now "is writing of his God upon the wall."  [Chorus]

    3.
    See the faith, zeal, and courage that would dare to do the right,
    Which the Spirit gave to Daniel this the secret of his might;
    In his home in Judea, or a captive in the hall,
    Yet he understood the writing of his God upon the wall.  [Chorus]

    4.
    All our deeds are recorded; there's a land that's writing now;
    Sinner, give your heart to Jesus, to his royal mandate bow;
    For the day is approaching, it must come to one and all,
    When the sinner's condemnation will be written the wall.  [Chorus]
 
 

## 49.  Weighed and Wanting

    1.
    When the Judge shall weigh our motives,
    For eternal gain or loss,
    Shall we stand as gold before him?
    Or as vile and worthless dross?

    Refrain:
    Weigh'd in the balance of the Lord,
    Weigh'd, weigh'd, and wanting;
    Weigh'd by the standard of his word,
    Weigh'd, weigh'd, and wanting.

    2.
    Shall we hear the glad words spoken:
    "Faithful servant," and "Well done,"
    Or the dread and awful sentence,
    "Thou are wanting," sinful one?  [Refrain]

    3.
    Shall we heed the Spirit's pleading,
    While for mercy we may call,
    Or delay till God's handwriting
    Seals the final doom of all?  [Refrain]

    Chorus:
    The best friend to have is Jesus,
    The best friend to have is Jesus,
    He will help you when you fall,
    He will hear you when you call;
    Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.

    2.
    What a friend I have found in Jesus!
    Peace and comfort to my soul He brings;
    Leaning on His mighty arm,
    I will fear no ill nor harm;
    Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Tho' I pass thro' the night of sorrow,
    And the chilly waves of Jordan roll,
    Never need I shrink nor fear,
    For my Saviour is so near;
    Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.  [Chorus]

    4.
    When at last to our home we gather,
    With the faithful who have gone before,
    We will sing upon the shore,
    Praising Him forevermore;
    Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.  [Chorus]

    I surrender all;
    All to Thee, my blessed Saviour,
    I surrender all.

    Worldly pleasures all forsaken,
    Take me, Jesus, take me now;  [Chorus]

    3.
    All to Jesus I surrender,
    Make me, Saviour, wholly Thine;
    Let me feel the Holy Spirit,
    Truly know that Thou art mine;  [Chorus]

    4.
    All to Jesus I surrender,
    Now I feel the sacred flame,
    O the joy of full salvation!
    Glory, glory to His name!  [Chorus]
 
 

## 52.  Jesus of Nazareth Passeth By
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_pD%2DgyLpG0nCrZmaT6dwROu4Ma_9uI4V/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    What means this eager, anxious throng
    Which moves with busy haste along,
    These wondrous gath'rings day by day?
    What means this strange commotion, pray?
    In accents hush'd the throng reply;
    "Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."
    In accents hush'd the throng reply:
    "Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."

    2.
    Who is this Jesus?  Why should he
    The city move, so mightily?
    A passing stranger, has he skill
    To move the multitude at will?
    Again the stirring notes reply:
    "Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."
    Again the stiring notes reply:  
    "Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."

    3.
    Jesus!  'tis he who once below
    Man's pathway trod, 'mid pain and woe;
    And burdened ones where e'er he came,
    Brought out their sick, and deaf and lame.
    The blind rejoiced to hear the cry:
    "Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."
    The blind rejoiced to hear the cry:
    "Jesus of Nazareth passeth by?"

    4.
    Today, he comes, from place to place
    His holy footprints we can trace;
    He pauseth at our threshold, nay,
    He enters, condescends to stay:
    Shall we not gladly raise the cry:
    "Jesus of Nazareth passeth by?"
    Shall we not gladly raise the cry
    "Jesus of Nazareth passeth by?"

    5.
    Ho!  all ye heavy laden, come!
    Here's pardon, comfort, rest, and home;
    Ye wand'rers from the Father's face,
    Return, accept his proffered grace.
    Ye tempted ones, there's refuge nigh:
    "Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."
    Ye tempted ones, there's refuge nigh:
    "Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."

    6.
    But if you still this call refuse,
    And all his wondrous love abuse,
    At last he'll sadly from you turn,
    Who now his invitation spurn.
    "Too late!  too late!" will be the cry
    "Jesus of Nazareth has passed by."
    "Too late!  too late!"  will be the cry
    "Jesus of Nazareth has passed by."

    But O that I might hear him welcome you too!  [Chorus]

    3.
    A robe fair and spotless, resplendent in whiteness,
    Is waiting in glory my wondering view;
    And when I receive it all shining in brightness,
    Dear friend, I would see you receiving one too!  [Chorus]

    4.
    To me has been given a peace like a river
    A peace that the friends of this world never knew;
    And Christ is the Author, and Christ is the Giver,
    And O that his peace might be given to you!  [Chorus]

    5.
    When Jesus has found you, tell others the story,
    That my loving Saviour is your Saviour too;
    Then pray that your Saviour may bring them to glory,
    And prayer will be answered 'twas answered for you!  [Chorus]

    Each evening nearer home,
    Keep tenting toward the highlands,

    Sowing the seed by the daylight fair,
    Sowing the seed by the noonday glare,
    Sowing the seed by the fading light,
    Sowing the seed in the solemn night.

    Chorus:
    Sown in the darkness or sown in the light,
    Sown in our weakness or sown in our might;
    Gathered in time or eternity,
    Sure, ah!  sure will the harvest be.

    Sowing the seed by the wayside high,
    Sowing the seed on the rocks to die,
    Sowing the seed where the thorns will spoil,
    Sowing the seed in the fertile soil.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Sowing the seed of a ling'ring pain,
    Sowing the seed of a maddened brain,
    Sowing the seed of a tarnished name,
    Sowing the seed of eternal shame.  [Chorus]

    Sowing in hope till the reapers come
    Gladly to gather the harvest home.  [Chorus]

    Or sinner find that He would not take him?
    No, not one!  no, not one!  [Chorus]

    5.
    Was e'er a gift like the Saviour given?  
    No, not one!  no, not one!
    Will He refuse us a home in heaven?
    No, not one!  no, not one!  [Chorus]

    1.
    Would you live for Jesus, and be always pure and good?
    Would you walk with Him within the narrow road?
    Would you have Him bear your burden, carry all your load?
    Let Him have His way with thee.

    Chorus:
    His pow'r can make you what you ought to be;
    His blood can cleanse your heart, and make you free;
    His love can fill your soul, and you will see
    'Twas best for Him to have His way with thee.

    2.
    Would you have Him make you free, and follow at His call?
    Would you know the peace that comes by giving all?
    Would you have Him save you, so that you need never fall?
    Let Him have His way with thee.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Would you in His kingdom find a place of perfect rest?
    Would you prove Him true in providential test?
    Would you in His service labor always at your best?
    Let Him have His way with thee.  [Chorus]

## 61.  The Ninety and Nine
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aDHhBHTIlTy0QoJMQKwiczvWEsLwCXFT/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There were ninety and nine that safely lay
    In the shelter of the fold,
    But one was out on the hills away,
    Far off from the gates of gold;
    Away on the mountains wild and bare,
    Away from the tender Shepherd's care,
    Away from the tender Shepherd's care.

    2.
    "Lord, thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;
    Are they not enough for Thee?"
    But the Shepherd made answer:  "One of mine
    Has wander'd away from me,
    And although the road be rough and steep,
    I go to the desert to find my sheep,
    I go to the desert to find my sheep."

    3.
    But none of the ransom'd ever knew
    How deep were the waters cross'd;
    Nor how dark was the night that the Lord pass'd thro'
    Ere He found His sheep that was lost.
    Out in the desert He heard its cry,
    Sick and helpless, and ready to die.
    Sick and helpless, and ready to die.

    4.
    "Lord, whence are these blood drops all the way
    That mark out the mountains' track?"
    They were shed for one who has gone astray,
    Ere the Shepherd could bring him back."
    "Lord, why are thy hands so rent and torn?"
    They are pierc'd to-night by many a thorn."
    "They are pierc'd to-night by many a thorn."

    5.
    But all through the mountains, thunder riven,
    And up from the rocky steep,
    There rose a cry to the gate of heaven,
    "Rejoice, I have found my sheep!"
    And the angels sang around the throne,
    "Rejoice for the Lord brings back His own!"

    1.
    What will you do with the King called Jesus?
    Many are waiting to hear you say,
    Some have despised Him, rejecting His mercy,
    What will you do with your King today?

    Who died to save you from sin's bitter thrall?
    Who will declare Him the fairest of thousands?
    Who now will crown Him the Lord of all?

    What will you do for the King called Jesus
    He who for you left His throne above?
    Here 'mid the lowly and sinful to labor,

    Who now is willing to toil with the few?
    What will you do for the dear Saviour Jesus?
    Lo, He is waiting, He calls for you!  [Chorus]

    3.
    What will you do with the King called Jesus,
    Who will submit to His gentle sway?
    Where are the hearts ready now to enthrone Him?
    Who will His kind commands obey?
    Come with your ointments most costly and precious,
    Pour out your gifts at the dear Saviour's feet;
    Render to Him all your loyal devotion;
    Seek to exalt Him by praises meet.  [Chorus]

    I'll look to the cross ev'ry day and hour,

    1.
    Yield not to temptation,
    For yielding is sin,

    Look ever to Jesus,
    He'll carry you through.

    Ask the Saviour to help you,
    Comfort, strengthen, and keep you;

    To him that o'ercometh,
    God giveth a crown,
    Through faith we shall conquer,

    Our strength will renew.
    Look ever to Jesus,
    He'll carry you through.  [Chorus]

    Angels will hasten the story to tell.

    Chorus:

## 68.  Let the Little Ones Come
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1abB32h_FmnF54RSrolSS1Mm%2DonOghoTt/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I think when I read that sweet story of old,
    When Jesus was here among men,
    How he call'd little children as lambs to his fold,
    I should like to have been with them then.
    I wish that his hands had been placed on my head,
    That his arm had been thrown around me,
    And that I might have seen his kind look when he said,
    "Let the little ones come unto me."

    2.
    Yet still is the Saviour in pray'r I may go,
    And ask for a share in his love,
    And if I thus earnestly seek him below,
    I shall see him and hear him above.
    In that beautiful plan he has gone to prepare
    For all who are wash'd and forgiv'n,
    Oh, may we at last find a glad welcome there,
    Safe at home in the kingdom of heav'n.
 
 

## 69.  Pure Gold

    1.
    Why labor for treasures that rust and decay,
    That sparkle a moment, then vanish away?
    Go rather to Jesus, with earnest desire,
    And buy of him "gold that is tried in the fire;"
    Salvation's a treasure of value untold;
    Be wise to obtain it, for this is PURE GOLD.

    2.
    Each promise contain'd in the Book he has giv'n,
    Directing the soul in its pathway to heav'n,
    Is priceless, eternal, unbounded, and free,
    More precious than diamonds, or gems of the sea;
    God's word is a treasure of value untold;
    O fail not to gain it, for this is PURE GOLD.

    3.
    The gift of the Spirit, which all may receive
    The rapture of pardon to all who believe
    An answer to pray'r when the heart is oppress'd
    The hope of a crown, and a mansion of rest
    All these are bright treasures of value untold;
    Make haste to secure them for they are PURE GOLD.

    Lead them, my God, to Thee, 
    Lead them to Thee.

    3.
    E'en for such little ones,
    Christ came a child,
    And in this world of sin
    Lived undefiled.
    O, for His sake, I pray,
    Lead them, my God, to Thee;
    Lead them, my God, to Thee, 
    Lead them to Thee.

    4.
    Yea, tho' my faith be dim,
    I would believe
    That Thou this precious gift
    Wilt now receive;
    O, take their young hearts now,
    Lead them, my God, to Thee;
    Lead them, my God, to Thee,
    Lead them to Thee.

    I am not too young to go,
    In the pathway where He leadeth,
    Not too young His will to know.  [Chorus]

    3.
    He is standing at the doorway
    Of escape from ev'ry sin;

    He will hear and let me in.  [Chorus]

    Father in heaven for ever to be.

    Behold, behold the Lamb of God,
    On the cross, on the cross;
    For you He shed His precious blood,
    On the cross, on the cross;
    O hear His agonizing cry,
    "Eloi, lama, sabachthani,"
    Draw near, and see your Saviour die,
    On the cross, on the cross.

    2.
    Behold His arms extended wide,
    On the cross, on the cross;
    Behold His bleeding hands and side,
    On the cross, on the cross;
    The sun withholds his rays of light,
    The heav'ns are clothed in shades of night.
    While Jesus doth for sinners fight,
    On the cross, on the cross.

    3.
    And now the mighty deed is done,
    On the cross, on the cross;
    The battle fought, the vict'ry won,
    On the cross, on the cross;
    "'Tis finished," now the Saviour cries;
    To heav'n He turns His languid eyes;
    Then bows His sacred head, and dies,
    On the cross, on the cross. 

    4.
    Where e'er I go, I'll tell the story
    Of the cross, of the cross;
    In nothing else my soul shall glory,
    Save the cross, save the cross;
    And this my constant theme shall be,
    Thro' time and in eternity,
    That Jesus shed His blood for me,
    On the cross, on the cross.

    1.
    By faith I view my Saviour dying
    On the tree, on the tree;
    To ev'ry sinner He is crying,
    Look to me, look to me.
    He bids the guilty now draw near,
    Repent, believe, dismiss their fear;
    Hark, hark!  what precious words I hear:
    Mercy's free, mercy's free.

    2.
    Jesus, the Lord of life, hath spoken
    Peace to me, peace to me;
    Now all my chains of sin are broken,
    I am free, I am free.
    Soon as I on His name believed,
    His pard'ning grace my soul received,
    And was from sin and death retrieved,
    Mercy's free, mercy's free.

    3.
    This precious truth, ye sinners hear it,
    Mercy's free, mercy's free;
    Ye ministers of God, declare it,
    Mercy's free, mercy's free,
    Visit the heathen's dark abode,
    Proclaim to all the love of God,
    And spread the glorious news abroad,
    Mercy's free, mercy's free.

    4.
    Long as I live I'll still be crying,
    Mercy's free, mercy's free;
    And thus shall be my theme when dying,
    Mercy's free, mercy's free.
    And when the vale of death I've passed,
    When lodged above the stormy blast,
    I'll sing while endless ages last,
    Mercy's free, mercy's free.

    It comes to me more and more;
    But since the dear Saviour has bid me come in,
    I'll enter the open door.

    2.
    I am lowest of those who love Him,
    I am weakest of those who pray;
    But I come as He has bidden,
    And He will not say me nay.  [Chorus]

    3.
    My mistakes His free grace will cover,
    My sins He will wash away,
    And the feet that shrink and falter,
    Shall walk thro' the gates of day.  [Chorus]

    But He feeds it above.  [Chorus]

    Oh, hearken now to the voice of Jesus;

    And a glad heav'nly home.  [Chorus]

    1.
    Almost persuaded now to believe.
    Almost persuaded Christ to receive.
    Seems now some soul to say, 
    "Go, Spirit, go Thy way,
    Some more convenient day
    On Thee I'll call."

    2.
    Almost persuaded, come, come, today:
    Almost persuaded; turn not away.
    Jesus invites you here,
    Angels are ling'ring near,
    Pray'rs rise from hearts so dear:
    O wand'rer come!

    3.
    Almost persuaded; harvest is past!
    Almost persuaded; doom comes at last!
    "Almost" can not avail,
    "Almost" is but to fail!
    Sad, and that bitter wail
    "Almost, but lost!"

    1.
    I stood outside the gate,
    A poor, wayfaring child:
    Within my heart there beat
    A tempest loud and wild;
    A fear oppressed my soul,
    That I might be too late;
    And oh, I trembled sore,
    And pray'd outside the gate,
    And pray'd outside the gate.

    2.
    "O Mercy!" loud I cried,
    "Now give me rest from sin!"
    "I will," a voice replied;
    And Mercy let me in;
    She bound my bleeding wounds,
    And soothed my heart, opprest;
    She washed away my guilt
    And gave me peace and rest,
    And gave me peace and rest. 

    3.
    In Mercy's guise I knew
    The Saviour long abused,
    Who often sought my heart,
    And wept when I refused;
    Oh!  what a blest return
    For all my years of sin!
    I stood outside the gate,
    And Jesus let me in,
    And Jesus let me in,

    O depth of mercy!  can it be
    That gate was left ajar for me?
    For me, for me?
    Was left ajar for me?

    Who seek thro' it salvation;
    The rich and poor, the great and small,
    Of ev'ry tribe and nation.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Press onward, then, tho' foes may frown;
    While mercy's gate is open
    Accept the cross, and win the crown,
    Love's everlasting token.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Beyond the river's brink we'll lay
    The cross that here is given,
    And bear the crown of life away,
    And love Him more in heaven.  [Chorus]

    Weeping will not save me
    Tho' my face were bathed in tears,
    That could not allay my fears,
    Could not wash the sins of years
    Weeping will not save me.

    Refrain:
    Jesus wept and died for me;

    Working will not save me.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Waiting will not save me
    Helpless, guilty, lost I lie,

    4.
    Faith in Christ will save me
    Let me trust thy weeping Son,
    Trust the work that he has done;

    Not saved are we by trying,

    By serpents on their way,
    To look to their own doing,
    That awful plague to stay;

    When humbled in the dust,
    Was of the Lord's revealing,
    It is not Try, but Trust.  [Chorus]

    3.
    No deeds of ours are needed
    To make Christ's merit more;
    No frames of mind, or feelings,
    Can add to His great store;
    'Tis simply to receive Him,
    The holy One and just,
    'Tis only to believe Him,

    1.
    Where is my wand'ring boy to-night
    The boy of my tenderest care,
    The boy that was once my joy and light,
    The child of my love and prayer?

    Chorus:
    O where is my boy to-night?
    O where is my boy to-night?
    My heart o'erflows, for I love him, he knows;
    O where is my boy to-night?

    2.
    Once he was pure as morning dew,
    As he knelt at his mother's knee;
    No face was so bright, no heart more true,
    And none was so sweet as he.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O could I see you now, my boy,
    As fair as is olden time,
    When prattle and smile made home a joy,
    And life was a merry chime;  [Chorus]

    4.
    Go for my wand'ring boy to-night;
    Go, search for him where you will;
    But bring him to me with all his blight,
    And tell him I love him still.  [Chorus]

    I'm kneeling at the mercy seat,

    Where Jesus answers pray'r.

    2.
    Scatter Thy life thro' ev'ry part,
    Scatter Thy life, thro' ev'ry part,
    Scatter Thy life, thro' ev'ry part,
    And sanctify the whole.

    Oh, that it now from heav'n might fall,
    And all my sins consume.

    Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call,
    Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call,
    Spirit of burning, come.

    1.
    Crowded is your heart with cares,
    Have you no room for Jesus:
    Captured by earth's golden snares,
    Have you no room for Jesus?
    Lo!  he's standing at your door,
    Knocking, knocking o'er and o'er;
    Hear him pleading evermore;
    Have you no room for Jesus?

    2.
    Wasting all your precious hours,
    Have you no work for Jesus?
    Spending these God-given pow'rs,
    Have you no work for Jesus?
    Striving not to conquer sin,
    Seeking not a soul to win,
    Bringing not a wand'rer in;
    Have you no work for Jesus?

    3.
    Seeking earth's possessions fair,
    Have you no time for Jesus?
    None for gracious deeds to spare,
    Have you no time for Jesus?
    Not a grain to store away,
    Naught your labor to replay,
    Not a joy for that great day
    When you shall meet with Jesus.

    4.
    Bearing only worthless leaves,
    Have you no fruit for Jesus?
    In your hands no precious sheaves,
    Have you no fruit for Jesus?
    Not a grain to store away,
    Naught your labor to repay,
    Not a joy for that great day
    When you shall meet with Jesus.

## 102.  A Sinner Like Me
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kyd4xRmXP8wk9qW1VjDP10P5fTQrQvra/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I was once far away from the Saviour,
    And as vile as a sinner could be;
    I wondered if Christ, the Redeemer,
    Could save a poor sinner like me.

    2.
    I wandered on in the darkness,
    Not a ray of light could I see,
    And the tho't filled my heart with sadness,
    There's no help for a sinner like me.

    3.
    And then in that dark, lonely hour,
    A voice sweetly whispered to me,
    Saying Christ, the Redeemer, has power
    To save a poor sinner like me.

    4.
    I listened, and lo!  'twas the Savior
    Who was speaking so kindly to me;
    I cried, I'm the chief of sinners,
    Oh, save a poor sinner like me.

    5.
    I then fully trusted in Jesus,
    And, oh, what a joy came to me!
    My heart was filled with his praises,
    For saving a sinner like me.

    6.
    No longer in darkness I'm walking,
    For the light is now shining on me,
    And now unto others I'm telling
    How he saved a poor sinner like me.

    7.
    And when life's journey is over,
    And I the dear Saviour shall see,
    I'll praise him for ever and ever,
    For saving a sinner like me.

    Refrain:
    Take me as I am,
    Take me as I am,
    Oh, bring thy free salvation nigh,
    And take me as I am.

    2.
    Helpless I am, and full of guilt,
    But yet thy blood for me was spilt;
    And thou canst make me what thou wilt,
    But take me as I am.  [Refrain]

    3.
    No preparation can I make,
    My best resolves I only break;
    Yet save me for thine own name's sake,
    And take me as I am.  [Refrain]

    4.
    I bow before thy mercy seat,
    Behold me, Savior, at thy feet;
    Thy work begin, thy work complete, 
    And take me as I am.  [Refrain]

    5.
    If thou hast work for me to do,
    Inspire my will, my heart renew;
    And work both in, and by me, too,
    And take me as I am.  [Refrain]

    6.
    And when at last the work is done,
    The battle fought, the vict'ry won,
    Still, still my cry shall be alone,
    Lord, take me as I am.  [Refrain]

    Will He say me nay?
    "Not till earth and not till heaven
    Pass away."

    Is He sure to bless?

    Answer, Yes."  Amen.

    Jesus, and shall it ever be,

    Ashamed of thee, whom angels praise,
    Whose glories shine through endless days?

    2.
    Ashamed of Jesus!  sooner far
    Let evening blush to own a star;
    He sheds the beams of light divine
    O'er this benighted soul of mine.

    Let midnight be ashamed of noon;
    'Twas midnight with my soul till he,

    On whom my hopes of heav'n depend!

    When I've no guilt to wash away;
    No tear to wipe, no good to crave,
    No fears to quell, no soul to save.

    6.

    Till then I boast a Saivour slain;

    That Christ is not ashamed of me!

    Behold the Saviour at the door!
    He gently knocks, has knocked before,

    You treat no other friend so ill.

    He counsels thee to buy of him
    Gold tried by fire, and raiment clean;
    Anoint thine eyes, that thou may'st see,
    And put away thy stains from thee.

    3.
    O, hear the faithful Witness' voice,
    He offers now a final choice;
    Thou art offensive, O lukewarm!
    Therefore be zealous and reform.

    4.
    His mission now is almost o'er,
    Before the throne he'll plead no more;
    The filthy must his filth retain,
    He that is holy, so remain.

    5.
    His locks with dews of night are wet,
    But at thy heart he ling'reth yet.
    Awake!  and open wide the door;
    Bid thy Beloved wait no more.

    6.
    Yes, bring him in, a welcome guest;
    So shalt thou in his presence rest,
    And in communion sweet and free,
    Shalt sup with him and he with thee.

    Shall life's swift passing years all fly,
    And still my soul in slumber lie?

    2.
    God calling yet!  shall I not rise?
    Can I his loving voice despise,
    And basely his kind care repay?
    He calls me still; can I delay?

    3.
    God calling yet!  and shall he knock,
    And I my heart the closer lock?
    He still is waiting to receive,
    And shall I dare his Spirit grieve?

    4.
    God calling yet!  and shall I give
    No heed, but still in bondage live?
    I wait, but he does not forsake:
    He calls me still; my heart, awake!

    5.
    God calling yet!  I cannot stay;
    My heart I yield without delay;
    Vain world, farewell!  from thee I part;
    The voice of God hath reached my heart.

    Far from the paths of Thee, our God,
    Far from the paths of Thee, our God.

    Hear us, great Shepherd of Thy sheep!
    Our wand'rings heal, our footsteps keep.
    We seek Thy shelt'ring fold again,  
    Nor shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain,
    Nor shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain.

    4.
    O God!  we praise Thee for Thy grace.
    How sweet the smiling of Thy face!
    O let Thy grace our hearts control,
    And fill with love each longing soul,
    And fill with love each longing soul.

    5.
    Teach us to know and love Thy way;
    And grant to life s remotest day,
    By Thine unerring guidance led,
    Our willing feet Thy paths may tread,
    Our willing feet Thy paths may tread.

    He offers you salvation,
    And points to joys above;
    And, longing, waits to make you
    The objects of his love.

    3.
    In living faith accept him,
    Give up all else beside;
    While grace is loudly calling,
    Look to the Crucified.

    Return unto your home,
    The gospel trump is sounding, 
    The jubilee is come.

    The Saviour's love is sealing
    Each monument of grace.

    The sprinkled blood as pleading 
    Its virtue as my own,
    And there my soul is reading
    Her title to Thy throne.
    The sprinkled blood as owning
    The weak one's feeblest plea;
    'Mid sighs, and tears, and groaning,
    It pleads, O Lord, with thee.

    4.
    O wondrous pow'r, that seeketh
    From sin to set me free!
    O precious blood, that speaketh!
    Should I not value thee?
    The sprinkled blood is shedding
    Its fragrance all around,
    It gilds the path we're treading,
    It makes our joys abound.

    To Christ's light yoke submitting,
    Come, and take up the cross. 

    4.
    O come and make the trial;
    Christ's service is release;
    If hard the self denial,
    Its fruit is joy and peace.
    His word your faith defending,
    Shall serve you for the strife;
    Peace all your steps attending;
    The prime, eternal life!
 
 

## 118.  Outside the Door
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GNwFQTiPaJ4gT2g0UJMXMDq7SJqz9vbV/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Jesus!  thou art standing
    Outside the fast-closed door,
    In lowly patience waiting
    To pass the threshold o'er:
    We bear the name of Christians,
    Thy name and sign we bear:
    O, shame, thrice shame upon us!
    To keep thee standing there.

    2.
    O Jesus!  thou art knocking;
    And lo!  that hand is scarred,
    And thorns thy brow encircle,
    And tears thy face have marred;
    O, love that passeth knowledge,
    So patiently to wait!
    O, sin that hath no equal,
    So fast to bar the gate!

    3.
    O Jesus!  thou art pleading
    In accents meek and low,
    "I died for you, my children,
    And will ye treat me so?"
    O Lord, with shame and sorrow
    We open now the door:
    Dear Saviour, quickly enter,
    And leave us nevermore!
 
 

## 119.  Forgive My Doubts
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FSH416RgN%2DrQ21qgxNNkkgV1nFDd7lGS/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Forgive, O Lord, the doubts that break
    Thy promises to me;
    Forgive me that I fail to take 
    My pardon, full and free.
    I sought to put my sins away,
    I strove to do Thy will,
    And yet, whene'er I tried to pray,
    My heart was doubting still.

    2.
    I tho't that Thou with jealous eyes
    Wast watching me alway,
    My deeds to mark, my steps to spy,
    Whene'er I went astray;
    I hoped that when, by days and years
    Of service and of prayer,
    I had besought Thy grace with tears,
    Thy mercy I might share.

    3.
    Forgive, O Father, this my sin,
    This jealous, doubting heart;
    For when men seek Thy love to win,
    And choose the better part,
    I know that, swifter than the light
    Leaps earthward from the sun,
    Thy pard'ning love,
    Thy rescuing might,
    Speed down to ev'ry one.
 
 

## 120.  He Speaks Within
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FNu0FKO7cWioNvkiUPZJVbP7hWpTBDMU/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Go not, my soul, in search of Him,
    Thou wilt not find him there,
    Not in the depths of shadow dim,
    Nor heights of upper air.
    For not in far off realms of space
    The Spirit hath its throne;
    In ev'ry heart it findeth place,
    And waiteth to be known.

    2.
    Tho't answereth alone to tho't,
    And Soul with soul hath kin:
    The outward God he findeth not
    Who finds not God within.
    And if the vision come to thee
    Reveal'd by inward sign,
    Earth will be full of Deity,
    And with his glory shine.

    3.
    O gift of gifts!  O grace of grace!
    That God should condescend
    To make thy heart his dwelling place
    And be thy daily Friend!
    For not in far off realms of space
    The Spirit hath its throne;
    In ev'ry heart it findeth place,
    And waiteth to be known.
 
 

## 121.  Weary of Earth
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N8o4xr2tyqDMowPKz25UegxBfv7lY86u/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Weary of earth and laden with my sin,
    I look to heav'n and long to enter in;
    But there no evil thing may find a home:
    And yet I hear a voice that bids me "Come."

    2.
    The while I fain would tread the heav'nly way,
    Evil is ever with me day by day;
    Yet on mine ears the gracious tidings fall,
    "Repent, return, thou shalt be loos'd from all."

    3.
    Cease, restless will!  thy lonely strife resign!
    I know too well how little strength is mine;
    Grant me, dear Lord, thy saving love to see:
    I strive no more, I give myself to thee.
 
 

## 122.  The Lord first empties whom he fills
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mohfe_7t6AbdKyvuulz%2DavWKmgTJfdmY/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The Lord first empties whom he fills,
    Casts down whom he would raise;
    He quickens when the letter kills,
    Exalting thus his praise.
    When he applies his healing blood
    Unto a sin-sick soul,
    This balsam, pow'rful, precious, good,
    Ne'er fails to make it whole.

    2.
    On us he spent his life and blood,
    Our losses to retrieve;
    Mankind's redemption now holds good
    For sinners who believe.
    Lord, I believe!  whate'er befall,
    A thankful heart be mine,
    A heart that answers to thy call,
    One that is wholly thine.
 
 

## 123.  'Arise, My Soul, Arise!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NFjhrJR7WPyv2vhIl%2DcR5qQnxb280saK/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Arise, my soul, arise,
    Shake off thy guilty fears;
    The bleeding Sacrifice
    In my behalf appears;
    Before the throne my Surety stands,
    Before the throne my Surety stands;
    My name is written on his hands.

    2.
    He ever lives above,
    For me to intercede;
    His all redeeming love,
    His precious blood to plead;
    His blood was shed for all our race,
    His blood was shed for all our race,
    And sprinkles now the throne of grace.

    3.
    Five bleeding wounds he bears,
    Received on Calvary;
    They pour effectual pray'rs,
    They strongly speak for me:
    "Forgive him, O, forgive!"  they cry, 
    "Forgive him, O, forgive!"  they cry,
    "Nor let the contrite sinner die!"

    4.
    The Father hears him pray,
    His dear, anointed One;
    He would not turn away
    The presence of his Son:
    His Spirit answers to the blood,
    His Spirit answers to the blood,
    And tells me I am born of God.
 
 

## 124.  Come Ye Disconsolate
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MXHszsJ1F8nHtMEIWI%2DVKFsgRQBE8afq/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish;
    Come to the mercy seat, fervently kneel;
    Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;
    Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.

    2.
    Joy of the comfortless, light of the straying,
    Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure;
    Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,
    "Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure."

    3.
    Here see the Bread of Life, see waters flowing
    Forth from the throne of God, pure from above;
    Come to the feast of love, come ever knowing
    Earth has no sorrow but heaven can remove.
 
 

## 125.  Come Unto Me
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MuFePSOIXTGcq93siXeEgSbQpi3GWOqJ/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Come unto me when shadows darkly gather,
    When the sad heart is weary and distressed;
    Seeking for comfort from your heav'nly Father,
    Come unto me, and I will give you rest.

    2.
    Large are the mansions in my Father's dwelling,
    Glad are those homes that sorrows never dim;
    Sweet are the harps in holy music swelling,
    Soft are the tones that raise the heav'nly hymn.

    3.
    There, like an Eden blossoming in gladness,
    Bloom the fair flow'rs by earth so rudely pressed;
    Come unto him all ye who droop in sadness,
    "Come unto me, and I will give you rest."
 
 

## 126.  Penitence
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGIRt4rJp4GKGIxjGbME8PfGJNX%2DZfKX/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jesus, let thy pitying eye
    Call back a wand'ring sheep;
    False to thee, like Peter, I
    Would fain like Peter, weep.
    Speak the reconciling word,
    And let thy mercy melt me down;
    Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
    And break my heart of stone.

    2.
    Saviour, Prince, enthroned above,
    Repentance to impart,
    Give me, thro' thy dying love,
    The humble, contrite heart;
    Give what I have long implor'd,
    A portion of thy grief unknown;
    Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
    And break my heart of stone.

    3.
    For thine own compassion's sake,
    The gracious wonder show;
    Cast my sins behind thy back,
    And wash me white as snow:
    If thy pity now is stirr'd,
    If now I do myself bemoan,
    Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
    And break my heart of stone.

    4.
    Clothe me with thy holiness,
    Thy meek humility;
    Put on me thy glorious dress
    Endue my soul with thee:
    Let thine image be restor'd,
    Thy name and nature let me prove;
    Fill me with thy fulness, Lord,
    And perfect me in love.
 
 

## 127.  Decisive Day
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MYJtoTlGUFlwNQF2XzU0dBzyLP4qla%2DE/edit?mode=html)



    1.
     The great decisive day is at hand, is at hand!
    The great decisive day is at hand;
    The day when Christ will come,
    To call his children home,
    And to seal the sinner's doom, is at hand, is at hand;
    And to seal the sinner's doom, is at hand.

    2.
    Those who made his crown of thorns will be there, will be there!
    Those who made his crown of thorns will be there!
    Those who smote him with the reed 
    Upon his sacred head,
    And made his temples bleed, will be there, will be there;
    And made his temples bleed, will be there.

    3.
    Where will the sinner hide in that day, in that day?
    Where will the sinner hide in that day?
    It will be in vain to call, 
    "Ye mountains on us fall,"
    For his hand will find out all  In that day, in that day;
    For his hand will find out all in that day.
 
 

## 128.  He Is Calling
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NFnUJrmmUEGqnCB5nwalWfUPn9%2DK4UB2/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There's a wideness in God's mercy,
    Like the wideness of the sea;
    There's a kindness in his justice,
    Which is more than liberty.

    Refrain:
    He is calling, "Come to me;" 
    Lord, I gladly follow thee!

    2.
    There is welcome for the sinner,
    And more graces for the good;
    There is mercy with the Saviour;
    There is healing in his blood.  [Refrain]

    3.
    There's no place where earthly sorrows
    Are more felt than up in heav'n;
    There's no place where earthly failings
    Have such kindly judgment giv'n.  [Refrain]

    4.
    For the love of God is broader
    Than the measure of man's mind;
    And the heart of the Eternal
    Is most wonderfully kind.  [Refrain]

    5.
    But we make his love too narrow,
    By false limits of our own;
    And we magnify his strictness
    With a zeal he will not own.  [Refrain]

    6.
    If our love were but more simple,
    We should take him at his word;
    And our lives would be all sunshine
    In the sweetness of our Lord.  [Refrain]
 
 

## 129.  God Is Love
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MoHj64rx6HFj0yGiocjtI%2DrOc6jejPFD/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God is love; His mercy brightens
    All the path in which we rove;
    Bliss He wakes, and woe He lightens:
    God is wisdom, God is love.

    2.
    Chance and change are busy ever;
    Man decays and ages move;
    But His mercy waneth never:
    God is wisdom, God is love.

    3.
    E'en the hour that darkest seemeth
    Will His changeless goodness prove;
    From the gloom His brightness streameth:
    God is wisdom, God is love.

    4.
    He with earthly cares entwineth
    Hope and comfort from above;
    Everywhere His glory shineth;
    God is wisdom, God is love.
 
 

## 130.  Sweet the Moments
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NIqndQbW_QTMkKpGuAPwsuOjW3o3oIVO/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,
    Which before the cross we spend;
    Life and health and peace possessing
    From the sinner's dying Friend.

    2.
    Truly blessed is this station,
    Low before His cross to lie,
    While we see divine compassion
    Beaming in His gracious eye.

    3.
    Here we feel our sins forgiven,
    While upon the Lamb we gaze;
    And our tho'ts are all of heaven,
    And our lips o'erflow with praise.
 
 

## 131.  Nothing But Leaves
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ISs%2DY7bYy8seGsU9cZzBUI%2DC1h9KNpXv/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Nothing but leaves!  The Spirit grieves
    O'er years of wasted life;
    O'er sins indulged while conscience slept,
    O'er vows and promises unkept,
    And reap from years of strife
    Nothing but leaves!  Nothing but leaves!

    2.
    Nothing but leaves!  No gathered sheaves
    Of life's fair ripening grain:
    We sow our seeds; lo!  tares and weeds,
    Words, idle words, for earnest deeds,
    Then reap, with toil and pain, 
    Nothing but leaves!  Nothing but leaves!

    3.
    Nothing but leaves!  Sad mem'ry weaves
    No vail to hide the past;
    And as we trace our weary way,
    And count each lost and misspent day,
    We sadly find at last
    Nothing but leaves!  Nothing but leaves.

    4.
    Ah, who shall thus  The Master meet,
    And bring but withered leaves?
    Ah, who shall at the Saviour's feet,
    Before the awful judgment seat
    Lay down for golden sheaves,
    Nothing but leaves!  Nothing but leaves!
 
 

## 132.  Heaven Is Not Far Away
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HzLRdHhpnLV8wPBSKtgg9xuEK8kiQXXa/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Heaven is not far away,
    When Jesus is near;
    Give your heart to him today,
    When Jesus is near.
    Place your trust in this dear Friend,
    He will keep you to the end;
    Heaven is not far away,
    When Jesus is near.

    2.
    Will you not repent, believe,
    When Jesus is near?
    Peace and pardon now receive,
    When Jesus is near.
    He will not your pray'r refuse,
    Come and now the Saviour choose;
    Heaven is not far away,
    When Jesus is near.

    3.
    Are you coming home to-day?
    When Jesus is near?
    Do not longer stay away,
    When Jesus is near.
    Cast your burdens on the Lord,
    He has promised in his word
    Heaven is not far away,
    When Jesus is near.
 
 

## 133.  Thou Art the Way
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IFfBXIyhvFHQCnQI_cRL1QnX8BlZigmB/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Thou art the Way, to thee alone,
    From sin and death we flee;
    And he who would the Father seek,
    Must seek him, Lord, by thee.

    2.
    Thou art the Truth; thy word alone,
    True wisdom can impart;
    Thou only canst inform the mind,
    And purify the heart.

    3.
    Thou art the Life; the rending tomb
    Proclaims thy conq'ring arm;
    And those who put their trust in thee,
    Nor death nor hell shall harm.

    4.
    Thou art the Way, the Truth, the life;
    Grant us that way to know,
    That truth to keep, that life to win,
    Whose joys eternal flow.
 
 

## 134.  Baptize Us Anew
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IIMlGCTeWuCL_MnvMuYz1Wen09xdYdl9/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Baptize us anew
    With pow'r from on high,
    With love, O refresh us!
    Dear Saviour, draw nigh.

    Chorus:
    We humbly beseech thee, Lord, Jesus, we pray,
    With love and the Spirit baptize us to-day.

    2.
    Unworthy we cry,
    Unholy, unclean, 
    O wash us and cleanse us
    From sin's guilty stain.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O heavenly dove,
    Descend from on high!
    We plead thy rich blessing;
    In mercy draw nigh.  [Chorus]

    4.
    O list the glad voice!
    From heaven it came:
    Thou art my beloved,
    Well pleased I am.

    Chorus:
    We praise thee, we bless the, dear Lamb that was slain
    We land and adore thee, Amen and Amen.
 
 

## 135.  Write Thy Law
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IX1lD4VZX%2DKwRnKGQ8Uf2guit6JtmBg_/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O that the Lord would guide my ways
    To keep his statutes still!
    O that my God would grant me grace
    To know and do his will!

    2.
    O send thy Spirit down to write
    Thy law upon my heart,
    Nor let my tongue indulge deceit,
    Nor act the liar's part.

    3.
    From vanity turn off my eyes,
    Let no corrupt design
    Nor covetous desires arise
    Within this soul of mine.

    4.
    Order my footsteps by thy word,
    And make my heart sincere;
    Let sin have no dominion, Lord,
    But keep my conscience clear.
 
 

## 136.  The Last Call of Mercy
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ID4YWfs5fgm7QMcD1oxrLlssSYEDZEyR/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The last call of mercy now lingers for thee;
    O sinner, receive it; to Jesus now flee!
    He often has called thee, but thou hast refused;
    His offered salvation and love are abused.

    2.
    O slight not the warning now offered at last,
    Till summer is ended and harvest is past;
    Till mercy, long slighted, has left thy heart's door,
    And pardon, sweet pardon is offered no more.

    3.
    While Jesus is calling, O turn not away;
    For swiftly approaches the dread Judgment day:
    The Spirit invites you, O why will you roam?
    Come now to life's waters, ye thirsty ones, come.
 
 

## 137.  There Is a Line
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HmByDPiZ7UXTxJtvR747GShd1xezhnsI/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There is a line by us unseen,
    That crosses ev'ry path,
    The hidden boundary between,
    The hidden boundary between
    God's patience and his wrath.

    2.
    O!  where is this mysterious bourne
    By which our path is crossed,
    Beyond which God himself hath sworn,
    Beyond which God himself hath sworn
    That he who goes is lost?

    3.
    How far may we go on in sin?
    How long will God forbear?
    Where does hope end?  And where begin, 
    Where does hope end?  And where begin
    The confines of despair?

    4.
    An answer from the skies is sent:
    "Ye that from God depart,
    While it is called today, repent,
    While it is called today, repent,
    And harden not your heart."
 
 

## 138.  The wonders of redeeming love
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hnd6sIOakUbDlrzhPkU_KzRlJM8g6Bw3/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The wonders of redeeming love
    Our highest thoughts exceed;
    The Son of God comes from above,
    For sinful man to bleed.

    2.
    He gives himself, his life, his all,
    A sinless sacrifice,
    For man he drains the cup of gall,
    For man the Maker dies.

    3.
    And now before his Father's face
    His precious blood he pleads;
    For those who seek the throne of grace
    His love still intercedes.
 
 

## 139.  Chief of Sinners
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HuIOFdxgiclLo2prfxOtzk7xZVRqMJcp/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Chief of sinners tho' I be,
    Jesus shed his blood for me,
    Died that I might live on high,
    Died that I might never die;
    As the branch is to the vine,
    I am his, and he is mine.

    2.
    O the height of Jesus' love!
    Higher than the heav'n above,
    Deeper than the deepest sea,
    Lasting as eternity;
    Love that found me wondrous tho't!
    Found me when I sought him not.

    3.
    Chief of sinners tho' I be,
    Christ is all in all to me;
    All my wants to him are known,
    All my sorrows are his own;
    Safe with him from earthly strife,
    He sustains the hidden life.
 
 

## 140.  Go to dark Gethsemane
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HgUpt1NNigRfbYGMquj4g38yM7DtidPF/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Go to dark Gethsemane,
    Ye that feel the tempter's power;
    Your Redeemer's conflict see,
    Watch with him one bitter hour;
    Turn not from his griefs away,
    Learn of Jesus how to pray.

    2.
    Follow to the judgment-hall;
    View the Lord of life arraigned;
    See the wormwood and the gall;
    See the pangs his soul sustained;
    Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;
    Learn of him to bear the cross.

    3.
    Calvary's mournful mountain climb;
    There, adoring at his feet,
    Mark that miracle of time,
    God's own sacrifice complete:
    "It is finished!" hear him cry;
    Learn of Jesus how to die.
 
 

## 141.  Thy Work Alone
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JfunOGROEAi860lX9P6fHk5XY9HzQrXl/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Not what these hands have done,
    Can save this guilty soul;
    Not what this toiling flesh has borne,
    Can make my spirit whole.
    Thy work alone, my Lord,
    Can ease this weight of sin;
    Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,
    Can give me peace within.

    2.
    Not what I feel or do,
    Can give me peace with God;
    Not all my prayers, or sighs, or tears,
    Can ease my awful load.
    Thy love to me, O God, 
    Not mine, O Lord, to thee,
    Can rid me of this dark unrest,
    And set my spirit free.

    3.
    No other work save thine,
    No meaner blood will do;
    No strength, save that which is divine,
    Can bear me safely through.
    I praise the God of grace,
    I trust his love and might.
    He calls me his, I call him mine;
    My God, my joy, my light.
 
 

## 142.  Cleansed
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JirVmZWkYms28yt0Nd76YMdjgqSFhMdA/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Cast out the buyers, Lord,
    The sellers bid depart;
    Cleanse me from carnal thought and word,
    And purify my heart.
    A temple would I be,
    Meet for the royal Son:
    Ye money-changers, fear and flee
    Before the Sinless One.

    2.
    The love of self o'erthrow;
    The love of God bring in,
    That ministers to all below,
    God's remedy for sin.
    Rise up!  thou Living Word,
    Thine arm of strength lay bare,
    That naught in me henceforth be heard
    But voice of praise and pray'r.

    3.
    When thus this robber's home
    Becomes a house of pray'r,
    Do Thou with all thy power come,
    And dwell forever there,
    The hopeless ones to cheer,
    And broken hearts make whole;
    In me do thou alone appear
    To ev'ry sin-sick soul.
 
 

## 143.  Born
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JrKL8zcuH_ok_xs4fd1KKDrKfuhI6clV/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How solemn are the words,
    And yet to faith how plain,
    Which Jesus uttered while on earth
    "Ye must be born again!"
    "Ye must be born again!"
    For so hath God decreed;
    No reformation will suffice
    'Tis life poor sinners need.

    2.
    "Ye must be born again!
    And life in Christ must have;
    In vain the soul may elsewhere go
    'Tis He alone can save.
    "Ye must be born again!"
    Or never enter heav'n;
    'Tis only blood-washed ones are there
    The ransomed and forgiv'n. 
 
 

## 144.  Coming
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JnZeIbvfe9f0NzAxi6KWr06XosVnHOIn/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    He's coming once again,
    To set his people free;
    That where he is, in glory bright,
    His saints may also be.
    Then lift the drooping head.
    Look up, rejoice and sing;
    He comes in majesty sublime,
    Salvation's glorious King!

    2.
    The earth shall quake with fear,
    The heav'ns shall flee away;
    And where shall guilty man appear
    In that tremendous day?
    No refuge then is night,
    No shelter from the blast;
    The night of vengeance vails the sky
    When mercy's day is past.

    3.
    His eyes of living flame,
    The wicked shall devour;
    No tongue will lightly speak the name
    Of Jesus in that hour.
    No scorn, no words of hate,
    For his meek foll'wers then;
    But prayers and tears that come too late,
    Will mark earth's mighty men.
 
 

## 145.  Just As I Am
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JxUYEpAKzRTse3TEK8YhaWVt5UFbN0Wq/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Just as I am, without one plea
    But that thy blood was shed for me,
    And that thou bid'st me come to thee,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    2.
    Just as I am, and waiting not
    To rid my soul of one dark blot,
    To thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    3.
    Just as I am, though tossed about
    With many' a conflict, many' a doubt
    "Fightings within, and fears without,"
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    4.
    Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind,
    Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
    Yea, all I need, in thee to find,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    5.
    Just as I am, thou wilt receive,
    Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
    Because thy promise I believe,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    6.
    Just as I am, thy love I own
    Has broken ev'ry barrier down;
    Now to be thine, and thine alone,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
 
 

## 146.  There Is a Fountain
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jomm3vCWztGU5h5LKra4zu8qbctO_CLc/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There is a fountain fill'd with blood,
    Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
    And sinners plung'd beneath that flood
    Lose all their guilty stains.
    Lose all their guilty stains,
    Lose all their guilty stains,
    And sinners plung'd beneath that flood
    Lose all their guilty stains.

    2.
    The dying thief rejoiced to see,
    That fountain in his day;
    And there may I, though vile as he,
    Wash all my sins away.
    Wash all my sins away,
    Wash all my sins away,
    And there may I, though vile as he,
    Wash all my sins away.

    3.
    Thou dying Lamb!  thy precious blood
    Shall never lose its pow'r,
    Till all the ransomed Church of God
    Are saved to sin no more.
    Are saved to sin no more,
    Are saved to sin no more.
    Till all the ransomed Church of God
    Are saved to sin no more.

    4.
    E'er since by faith I saw the stream
    Thy flowing wounds supply,
    Redeeming love has been my theme,
    And shall be till I die.

    5.
    Lord, I believe thou hast prepared,
    Unworthy though I be,
    For me a blood-bought, free reward
    Eternal life for me.

    6.
    There in a nobler, sweeter song,
    I'll sing thy pow'r to save,
    When this poor lisping, stam'ring tongue
    Is ransom'd from the grave.
 
 

## 147.  Flee As a Bird
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JcdbeECBgVH5kXM5SxOUpCjoSerEB_%2DL/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Flee as a bird to your mountain,
    Thou who art weary of sin;
    Go to the clear-flowing Fountain,
    Where you may wash and be clean;
    Fly, for th' avenger is near thee,
    Call, and the Saviour will hear thee,
    He on his bosom will bear thee,
    O thou who art weary of sin,
    O thou who art weary of sin.

    2.
    He will protect thee forever,
    Wipe ev'ry falling tear;
    He will forsake thee, oh, never,
    Sheltered so tenderly there!
    Haste, then, the daylight is flying,
    Spend not the moments in sighing,
    Cease from your sorrow and crying,
    The Saviour will wipe ev'ry tear,
    Yes, Jesus will wipe ev'ry tear.
 
 

## 148.  I Bring My Sins to Thee
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jl1QG4wQ326UOS%2D3z0Q8YiodyQWz_drQ/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I bring my sins to Thee,
    The sins I cannot count,
    That all may cleansed be,
    In thy once opened Fount; 
    I bring them, Saviour, all to thee;
    The burden is too great for me.

    2.
    I bring my grief to Thee,
    The grief I cannot tell;
    No words shall needed be,
    Thou knowest all so well:
    I bring the sorrow laid on me,
    O suff'ring Saviour!  all to thee.

    3.
    My heart to thee I bring,
    The heart I cannot read,
    A faithless, wand'ring thing,
    An evil heart indeed:
    I bring it, Saviour, now to thee,
    That fix'd and faithful it may be.

    4.
    My life I bring to thee,
    I would not be my own;
    O Saviour let me be Thine, ever thine alone
    My heart, my life, my all, I bring
    To thee, my Saviour and my King.
 
 

## 149.  Take All My Sin Away
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JgSEtom7Z8Nq5uVPYrmHolydzWwEodp6/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O spotless Lamb!  I come to thee,
    No longer can I from thee stay;
    Break ev'ry chain, now set me free,
    Take all my sin away.

    Chorus:
    Take all my sin away,
    Take all my sin away;
    O spotless Lamb, I come to thee;    
    Take all my sin away.

    2.
    Weary I am of inbred sin,
    Oh, wilt thou not my soul release?
    Enter and speak me pure within,
    Give me thy perfect peace.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I plunge beneath thy precious blood,
    My hand in faith takes hold of thee;
    Thy promises just now I claim;
    Thou art enough for me.   

    Chorus:
    Take all my sin away,
    Take all my sin away;
    O spotless Lamb, I come to thee;
    He takes my sin away.
 
 

## 150.  Remember Me
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JkaFCHBjPHAKlVg7Epj05rZ9p0AhCBOs/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Alas!  and did my Saviour bleed?
    And did my Sov'reign die?
    Would he devote that sacred head
    For such a worm as I?

    Chorus:
    Help me, dear Saviour, thee to own,
    And ever faithful be;
    And when thou sittest on thy throne,
    O Lord, remember me.

    2.
    Was it for crimes that I have done,
    He groaned upon the tree?
    Amazing pity!  grace unknown!
    And love beyond degree!

    3.
    Well might the sun in darkness hide,
    And shut his glories in,
    When Christ the mighty Maker died
    For man, the creature's sin.

    4.
    Thus might I hide my blushing face,
    While his dear cross appears,
    Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
    And melt mine eyes to tears.

    5.
    But drops of grief can ne'er repay
    The debt of love I owe;
    Here, Lord, I give myself away;
    'Tis all that I can do.
 
 

## 151.  The Waters Are Troubled
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FeR6h33AdOn3mrmMLAK662ejuGwZmjv2/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The waters are troubled,
    The angel is here;
    The fountain of mercy
    Flows healing and clear:
    O come in your sorrow,
    And come in your sin;
    The waters are troubled:
    Step in, O step in!

    2.
    The waters are troubled,
    No longer delay;
    The fountain of mercy
    Has healing today;
    Then why will you linger,
    Since lift you may win?
    The waters are troubled:
    Step in, O step in!

    3.
    The waters are troubled
    The angel still waits;
    He pauses in peril
    Who halts and debates,
    Give over your falt'ring,
    Your struggles within;
    The waters are troubled:
    Step in, O step in!
 
 

## 152.  Not Blood of Beasts
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G1H_PT7PgTa15wGa6ToqW7w3GmoLq0Ha/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Not all the blood of beasts
    On Jewish altars slain,
    Could give the guilty conscience peace,
    Or wash away the stain.

    2.
    But Christ, the heav'nly Lamb,
    Takes all our sins away;
    A sacrifice of nobler name
    And rich blood than they.

    3.
    My faith would lay her hand
    On that dear head of thine,
    While like a penitent I stand,
    And there confess my sin.
 
 

## 153.  Rest Found
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GCrbZCsCvmJL2sRUMrTsk4gGjC74BA64/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O where shall rest be found
    Rest for the weary soul?
    'Twere vain the ocean's depths to sound,
    Or pierce to either pole.

    2.
    Beyond this vale of tears
    There is a life above,
    Unmeasured by the flight of years;
    And all that life is love.

    3.
    Thro' Christ, the Life, the Way,
    May we that life obtain;
    And thro' the merits of his blood,
    That endless glory gain.
 
 

## 154.  Depths of Mercy
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FpBJ6IhmxcIAe3Berqx3n_gKLm7AraGI/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Depth of mercy!  can there be
    Mercy still reserved for me?
    Can my God his wrath forbear?
    Me, the chief of sinners, spare?

    2.
    I have long withstood his grace,
    Long provoked him to his face,
    Would not hearken to his calls,
    Griev'd him by a thousand falls.

    3.
    There for me the Saviour stands,
    Shows his wounds and spreads his hands;
    God is love!  I know, I feel;
    Jesus weeps, and loves me still.
 
 

## 155.  'Come, My Soul'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FrjykyfJPYozDejZp48ZNhcVN%2DAJ03Lj/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Come, my soul, thy suit prepare!
    Jesus loves to answer pray'r;
    He himself has bid thee pray,
    Therefore will not say thee nay.

    2.
    With my burden I begin!
    Lord, remove this load of sin;
    Let thy blood, for sinners spilt,
    Set my conscience free from guilt.

    3.
    Lord, I come to thee for rest,
    Take possession of my breast;
    There, thy sovereign right maintain,
    And without a rival reign.
 
 

## 156.  'For Others'' Guilt'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fxlo8pBPFMzPBshu4qAuSkeNMBTRx%2D%2DF/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    'Tis midnight; and on Olives' brow
    The star is dimmed that lately shone;
    'Tis midnight; in the garden now
    The suff'ring Saviour prays alone.

    2.
    'Tis midnight; and from all removed,
    The Saviour wrestles lone with fears;
    E'en that disciple whom he loved
    Heeds not his Master's grief and tears.

    3.
    'Tis midnight; and for others' guilt
    The Man of sorrows weeps in blood;
    Yet he who hath in anguish knelt,
    Is not forsaken by his God.

    4.
    'Tis midnight; and from other plains
    Is borne the song that angels know;
    Unheard by mortals are the strains
    That sweetly soothe the Saviour's woe.
 
 

## 157.  That Dreadful Day
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G9asMSq13eTQIa473haW4E9zmFUsDdzH/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The day of wrath, that dreadful day,
    When heav'n and earth shall pass away!
    What pow'r shall be the sinner's stay?
    How shall he meet that dreadful day?

    2.
    When shriv'ling like a parched scroll,
    The flaming heav'ns together roll,
    And louder yet, and yet more dread,
    Resounds the trump that wakes the dead,

    3.
    On that great day, that wrathful day,
    When man to Judgment wakes from clay,
    Be thou, O Christ, thy people's stay,
    Tho' heav'n and earth shall pass away.
 
 

## 158.  Seals My Pardon
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G6GH78sn0bpZEMe_C6csaYwkhetQMYgU/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I saw One hanging on the tree,
    In agony and blood,
    Who fixed His languid eyes on me,
    As near His cross I stood.

    2.
    O, never till my latest breath
    Can I forget that look;
    It seemed to charge me with His death,
    Tho' not a word He spoke.

    3.
    A second look He gave, which said, 
    "I freely all forgive;
    This blood is for thy ransom paid,
    I die that thou may'st live."

    4.
    Thus while His death my sin displays
    In all its blackest hue,
    Such is the mystery of grace,
    It seals my pardon too.
 
 

## 159.  'Shall Our Cheeks Be Dry?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fej4e01vx8HPMCKvLs5EEPdQZzE5qMiC/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Did Christ o'er sinners weep?
    And shall our cheeks be dry?
    Let floods of penitential grief
    Burst forth from ev'ry eye.

    2.
    The Son of God in tears,
    The wond'ring angels see!
    Be thou astonished, O my soul!
    He shed those tears for thee.

    3.
    He wept; shall we not weep?
    He died; shall we not die?
    He rose; shall we not rise from sleep,
    To reign with him on high?
 
 

## 160.  A Closer Walk
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FxCTvVq1AzzMk4MWE5hDrscjYHvMZ2qs/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O, for a closer walk with God!
    A calm and heav'nly frame,
    A light to shine upon the road
    That leads me to the Lamb.

    2.
    Return, O holy Dove!  return,
    Sweet Messenger of rest;
    I hate the sins that made thee mourn,
    And drove thee from my breast.

    3.
    What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!  
    How sweet their mem'ry still!
    But they have left an aching void
    The world can never fill.

    4.
    The dearest idol I have known,
    Whate'er that idol be,
    Help me to tear it from thy throne,
    And worship only thee.

    1.
    Come, Holy Spirit, come,
    Let thy bright beams arise,
    Dispel the sorrow from our minds,
    The darkness from our eyes.

    2.
    Convince us all of sin,
    Then lead to Jesus' blood,
    And to our wond'ring view reveal
    The mercies of our God.

    3.
    'Tis thine to cleanse the heart,
    To sanctify the soul,
    To pour fresh life in ev'ry part,
    And new create the whole.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NyhO1C_HYBPeGyQvgnvinrrTg%2DxyANgb/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O, could I find, from day to day,
    A nearness to my God,
    Then would my hours glide sweet away,
    While leaning on his word.

    2.
    Lord, I desire with thee to live
    Anew from day to day,
    In joys the world can never give,
    Nor ever take away.

    3.
    Blest Jesus, come, and rule my heart,
    And make me wholly thine,
    That I may nevermore depart,
    Nor grieve thy love divine.

    1.
    Holy Spirit, light divine,
    Shine upon this heart of mine,
    Chase the shades of night away,
    Turn my darkness into day.

    2.
    Holy Spirit, pow'r divine,
    Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
    Long has sin, without control,
    Held dominion o'er my soul.

    3.
    Holy Spirit, all divine,
    Dwell within this heart of mine,
    Cast down ev'ry idol throne,
    Reign supreme, and reign alone.

    1.
    Come, gracious Spirit, heavenly Dove,
    With light and comfort from above;
    Be thou our Guardian, thou our Guide;
    O'er all our thoughts and steps preside.

    2.
    To us the light of truth display,
    And make us know and choose thy way;
    Plant holy fear in ev'ry heart,
    That we from God may ne'er depart.

    3.
    Lead us to holiness, the road
    That we must take to dwell with God:
    Lead us to Christ, the living way,
    Nor let us from his precepts stray.

    4.
    Lead us to God, our final rest,
    To be with Him forever blest;
    Lead us to heav'n, its bliss to share
    Fulness of joy forever there!

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OSsMBVfwI2LMJDOuUz9QAUIHlqZV_vdG/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Come to the living waters, come!
    Obey your Maker's call;
    Return, ye weary wand'rers, home;
    My grace is free for all,
    My grace is free for all.

    2.
    Nothing ye in exchange shall give;
    Leave all you have behind;
    Freely the gift of God receive,
    And peace in Jesus find,
    And peace in Jesus find.

    3.
    I bid you all my goodness prove;
    My promises are free:
    Come, taste the manna of my love,
    Delight your souls in me,
    Delight your souls in me.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O96zs39xw%2DGarEqXtkmVVtyokJiI6YzA/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O for that flame of living fire
    Which shone so bright in saints of old;
    Which bade their souls to heav'n aspire,
    Calm in distress, in danger bold!

    2.
    Where is that spirit, Lord, which dwelt 
    In Abram's breast, and sealed him thine?
    Which made Paul's heart with sorrow melt,
    And glow with energy divine?

    3.
    Is not thy grace as mighty now
    As when Elijah felt its pow'r?
    When glory beamed from Moses' brow,
    Or Job endured the trying hour?

    4.
    Remember, Lord, the ancient days;
    Renew thy work, thy grace restore;
    And while to thee our hearts we raise,
    On us thy Holy Spirit pour.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O59kwDJh_bh7U4D7K9DBC7QelmpVHLkN/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Return, O wanderer, return,
    And seek thy Father's face;
    Those new desires which in thee burn,
    Were kindled by his grace.

    2.
    Return, O wanderer, return;
    Thy Saviour bids thee live;
    Come to his cross, and, grateful, learn
    How freely he'll forgive.

    3.
    Return, O wanderer, return,
    And wipe the falling tear;
    Thy Father calls no longer mourn;
    'Tis love invites thee near.
 
 

## 168.  Jesus Calls Us
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O1dMdx%2D_IAS_HYUHmZBYNE8ZBzawVO0Y/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jesus calls us, o'er the tumult
    Of our life's wild, restless sea;
    Day by day His sweet voice soundeth,
    Saying, Christian, follow me!

    2.
    Jesus calls us from the worship
    Of the vain world's golden store;
    From each idol that would keep us,
    Saying, Christian, love me more!

    3.
    In our joys and in our sorrows,
    Days of toil and hours of ease,
    Still He calls, in cares and pleasures,
    Christian, love me more than these!

    4.
    Jesus calls us!  by Thy mercies,
    Saviour, may we hear Thy call,
    Give our hearts to Thy obedience,
    Serve and love Thee best of all!
 
 

## 169.  Parting With Self
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N_jvLbrxVtBfR_VixQHx5Yn66h8NciFA/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    And must I part with all of self,
    My dearest Lord, for thee?
    It is but right since thou hast done
    Much more than this for me.

    2.
    Yes, let it go; one look from thee
    Will more than make amends
    For all the losses I sustain
    Of honor, riches, friends.

    3.
    Ten thousand worlds, ten thousand lives,
    How worthless they appear
    Compared with thee, supremely good,
    Divinely bright and fair!
 
 

## 170.  Take My Heart
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nahvv4SZbKVfPi%2D5j8ZFzo9pkQCdIYVh/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Take my heart, O Father, take it!
    Make and keep it all Thine own;
    Let Thy Spirit melt and break it,
    This proud heart of sin and stone.

    2.
    Father, make it pure and lowly,
    Fond of peace and far from strife;
    Turning from the paths unholy,
    Of this vain and sinful life.

    3.
    Ever let Thy race surround me,
    Strengthen me with pow'r divine;
    By Thy cords of love that bound me,
    Make me to be wholly Thine.

    4.
    May the blood of Jesus heal me,
    And my sins be all forgiv'n;
    Holy Spirit, take and seal me, 
    Guide me in the path to heav'n.
 
 

## 171.  One Above All Others
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KH6280a8pwoLEhOia45T%2Dhe92LNy5By0/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    One there is above all others,
    Well deserves the name of Friend;
    His is love beyond a brother's,
    Costly, free, and knows no end.

    2.
    Which of all our friends, to save us,
    Could or would have shed his blood?
    But our Jesus died to have us
    Reconciled in him to God.

    3.
    O for grace our hearts to soften!
    Teach us, Lord, to truly love;
    We, alas!  forget too often
    What a Friend we have above.
 
 

## 172.  The Wondrous Cross
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KWW3%2DBrWGz4RSN_TCAZgw6tv4sk6VJP4/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    When I survey the wondrous cross
    On which the prince of glory died,
    My richest gain I count but loss,
    And pour contempt on all my pride.

    2.
    See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
    Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
    Did e'er such love and sorrow meet?
    Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

    3.
    Since I, who was undone and lost,
    Have pardon thro' his name and word;
    Forbid it, then, that I should boast,
    Save in the cross of Christ, my Lord.

    4.
    Were the whole realm of nature mine,
    That were a tribute far too small;
    Love so amazing, so divine,
    Demands my life, my soul, my all.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KUaJ18UfHlhmGq0J4xhmdelTXEbcqHgW/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    To-day the Saviour calls;
    Ye wand'rers, come;
    O ye benighted souls,
    Why longer roam?

    2.
    To-day the Saviour calls;
    Oh, hear him now;
    Within these sacred walls
    To Jesus bow.

    3.
    To-day the Saviour calls;
    For refuge fly;
    The storm of justice falls,
    And death is nigh.

    4.
    The Spirit calls to-day;
    Yield to his pow'r,
    Oh, grieve him not away,
    'Tis mercy's hour.
 
 

## 174.  Even Me
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K8GPeq3l1Kd9YTUtm60s0eTLJq1o2tCp/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Lord, I hear of show'rs of blessing
    Thou art scatt'ring full and free;
    Show'rs the thirsty soul refreshing;
    Let some drops now fall on me;

    Refrain:
    Even me, even me,
    Let some drops now fall on me.

    2.
    Pass me not, O gracious Father!
    Sinful though my heart may be;
    Thou might'st leave me, but the rather
    Let thy mercy rest on me.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Have I long in sin been sleeping?
    Long been slighting, grieving thee?
    Has the world my heart been keeping?
    O forgive and rescue me!  [Refrain]

    4.
    Pass me not, O holy Spirit!
    Thou canst make the blind to see;
    Testify of Jesus' merit,
    Speak the word of peace to me.  [Refrain]
 
 

## 175.  Angels Hovering Round

    1.
    There are angels hov'ring round,
    There are angels hov'ring round,
    There are angels, angels hov'ring round.

    2.
    To carry the tidings home,
    To the New Jerusalem,
    There are, etc.

    3.
    Let him that heareth, come,
    O come, while yet there's room;
    There are, etc.
 
 

## 176.  I Will Not Let Thee Go
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KH9qzC_PwaEyg5NaXuYsqf9Dx4MotEqO/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Come, O thou Traveler unknown,
    Whom still I bold, but can not see;
    My company before is gone,
    And I am left alone with thee;
    With thee all night I mean to stay,
    And wrestle till the break of day.

    2.
    I need not tell thee who I am;
    My sin and misery declare;
    Thyself hast called me by my name,
    Look on thy hands, and read it there;
    But who, I ask thee, who art thou?
    Tell me thy name, and tell me now.

    3.
    In vain thou strugglest to get free;
    I never will unloose my hold;
    Art thou the Man that died for me?
    The secret of thy love unfold;
    Wrestling, I will not let thee go,
    Till I thy name, thy nature know.
 
 

## 177.  Broad Is the Road
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KSRG8ptphNbGHV0xNnumMu3m0sHF0mft/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Broad is the road that leads to death,
    And thousands walk together there;
    But wisdom shows a narrow path,
    With here and there a traveler.

    2.
    Deny thyself, and take thy cross,
    Is thy Redeemer's great command;
    Nature must count her gold but dross,
    If she would gain that heav'nly land.

    3.
    The fearful soul that tires and faints,
    And walks the ways of God no more;
    Is but esteem'd almost a saint,
    And makes his own destruction sure.
 
 

## 178.  'Come, Ye Sinners'

    1.
    Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,
    Weak and wounded, sick and sore;
    Jesus ready stands to save you,
    Full of pity, love, and pow'r.

    Chorus:
    Turn to the Lord, and seek salvation,
    Sound the praise of his dear name;
    Glory, honor, and salvation,
    Christ the Lord is come to reign.

    2.
    Now ye needy, come and welcome,
    God's free bounty glorify;
    True belief and true repentance,
    Ev'ry grace that brings you nigh.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Let not conscience make you linger,
    Nor of fitness fondly dream;
    All the fitness he requireth
    Is to feel our need of him.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Come, ye weary, heavy-laden,
    Bruised and mangled by the fall,
    If you tarry till you're better,
    You will never come at all.  [Chorus]

    Come to Jesus, Come to Jesus,
    Come to Jesus just now;
    Just now come to Jesus,
    Come to Jesus just now.

    2.
    He will save you, etc.

    3.
    He is able, etc.

    4.
    Call upon him, etc.

    5.
    He is waiting, etc.

    Only trust him, etc.

## 180.  Come to Me
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kk_Y5civezc0LntrYrJ_riyrDU%2DHIopY/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    With tearful eyes I look around;
    Life seems a dark and stormy sea,
    Yet, mid the gloom, I hear a sound,
    A heavenly whisper, "Come to me."

    2.
    It tells me of a place of rest;
    It tells me where my soul may flee:
    O, to the weary, faint, oppressed,
    How sweet the bidding, "Come to me.

    3.
    "Come, for all else must fail and die!
    Earth is no resting place for thee;
    To heav'n direct thy weeping eye,
    I am thy portion; come to me."

    4.
    O voice of mercy!  voice of love!
    In conflict, grief, and agony,
    Support me, cheer me from above!
    And gently whisper, "Come to me."

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MG4BfQfiR73sz4e62h%2D71MuB60ghet3G/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Give, thou, thy youth to God,
    With all its budding love;
    Send up thy op'ning heart to him,
    Fix it on things above.

    2.
    He seeks thy heart, my child;
    He wants to make thee blest;
    Thy soul with his own joy to fill,
    To give thee peace and rest.

    3.
    Take, thou, the side of God,
    In all things great or small,
    So shall he ever take thy side,
    And bear thee safe thro' all.
 
 

## 182.  He Calls the Lambs
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LZpU2qdXGxCC8gzy0ztJ6qAZXRjV0klG/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    See, Israel's gentle shepherd stands,
    With all-engaging charms;
    Hark, how He calls the tender lambs.
    And folds them in His arms!

    2.
    "Permit them to approach," He cries,
    "Nor scorn their humble name;
    For 'twas to bless such souls as these,
    The Lord of angels came."

    3.
    We bring them, Lord, in thankful hands,
    And yield them up to Thee;
    Joyful that we ourselves are Thine,
    Thine let our offspring be.
 
 

## 183.  A Heart of Praise
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MSz4Gl5SxqI8cXmDz6CIJ7cqFeS8vhol/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Oh, for a heart to praise my God!
    A heart from sin set free,
    A heart that always feels Thy blood,
    So freely shed for me.

    2.
    A heart resigned, submissive, meek,
    My dear Redeemer's throne,
    Where only Christ is heard to speak,
    Where Jesus reigns alone.

    3.
    A heart in ev'ry tho't renewed,
    And full of love divine,
    Perfect, and right, and pure, and good,
    A copy, Lord, of Thine.

    4.
    Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
    Come quickly from above:
    Write Thy new name upon my heart,
    Thy new, best name of Love.
 
 

## 184.  On Trifling Cares
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MMeYvUIAkr%2DI11RGXqPx38NixiU5HXTZ/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Why do we waste on trifling cares
    That life which God's compassion spares,
    While in the various range of thought,
    The one thing needful is forgot?

    2.
    Shall God invite us from above? 
    Shall Jesus urge his dying love?
    Shall troubled conscience give us pain?
    And all these pleas unite in vain?

    3.
    Not so our eyes will always view
    Those objects which we now pursue;
    Not so will heav'n and hell appear,
    When death's decisive hour is near.

    4.
    Almighty God, thy grace impart;
    Fix deep conviction on each heart;
    Nor let us waste on trifling cares
    That life in which thy compassion spares.
 
 

## 185.  Cross and Crown
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lh55l0AsGMoQWy4nFNcpmQpHEwvrOzxC/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
    And all the world go free?
    No, there's a cross for ev'ry one,
    And there's a cross for me.

    2.
    The consecrated cross 'll bear,
    Till He shall set me free;
    And then go home my crown to wear,
    For there's a crown for me.

    3.
    Upon the crystal pavement, down
    At Jesus' pierced feet,
    With joy I'll cast my golden crown,
    And his dear name repeat.

    Father, I stretch my hands to thee;
    No other help I know;
    If thou withdraw thyself from me,
    Ah, whither shall I go?

    2.
    On thy dear Son I now believe,
    O let me feel thy pow'r;
    And all my varied wants relieve,
    In this accepted hour.

    3.
    Author of faith!  to thee I lift
    My weary, longing eyes:
    O let me now receive that gift;
    My soul without it dies.

    1.
    When, my Saviour, shall I be
    Perfectly conformed to thee?
    Poor and vile in my own eyes,
    Only in thy wisdom wise;

    2.
    Only thee content to know,
    Ignorant of all below;
    Only guided by thy light,
    Only mighty in thy might?

    3.
    Fully in my life express
    All the hights of holiness;
    Sweetly let my spirit prove
    All the depths of humble love.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LpRvidZoR_U4XAaPo5K810qcnkcNRBr%2D/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God shall be first in ev'rything;
    No other gods before him;
    Creator and Redeemer King,
    'Tis pleasure to adore him.

    2.
    First when with rosy morn I wake,
    His pow'r mine eyes unsealing;
    First when his bounteous gifts I take,
    His Father love revealing.

    3.
    First when the crowding cares of day
    Impatient press upon me;
    First when the gentle twilight ray
    With peaceful calm falls on me.

    4.
    First when I leave mortality,
    The glad new song upraising;
    First all Eternity, where we
    Shall dwell who here are praising.
 
 

## 189.  Something for Jesus
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ll3OWx0U52dpsxWYy5LbSLNC197EgPDi/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    They bro't their gifts to Jesus,
    And laid them at his feet,
    And love for this dear Saviour,
    Made ev'ry off'ring sweet;
    Good deeds and words of kindness,
    Help for the poor of earth,
    And not a gift among them
    Was tho't of little worth.

    Chorus:
    Wouldst bring a gift to Jesus,
    That he will count most sweet?
    Say, "Lord, my heart I give thee,"
    And lay it at his feet.

    2.
    Apart from other givers
    A poor wayfarer stood;
    He saw the gifts they offered,
    The poorest counted good,
    And he was filled with longing,
    A gift, tho' poor, to bring;
    Alas!  all empty handed 
    He stood before the King.  [Chorus]

    3.
    "Dear Lord," he cried in sorrow,
    "I know how kind thou art,
    Take all I have to give thee,
    My sinful, wayward heart."
    Then Jesus answered softly,
    "Count not the gift as small,
    Tho' all of them are precious,
    Thine is the best of all.  [Chorus]

    Hallelujahs to Jesus! 
    Hallelujahs forever!
    His wondrous salvation our tongues shall declare.
    Sound the life invitation,
    Call the glad coronation;
    The Lord of creation the crown shall wear.

    2.
    Strike the cymbals of gladness,
    Hush the lone harps of sadness;
    He lives who redeemed us from death's awful gloom.
    Tell the wonderful story,
    From the manger to glory;
    All hail to King Jesus who burst the tomb!

    3.
    With the angels uniting,
    In his praises delighting,
    Both here and in heav'n shall our joy anthem ring.
    For his love ever vernal,
    For his mercy eternal, 
    Let glory supernal crown Jesus Christ.

    1.
    To God be the glory, great things He hath done,
    So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
    Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,
    And opened the Life-gate that all may go in.

    Chorus:
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
    Let the earth hear His voice;
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, 
    Let the people rejoice;
    O come to the Father, thro' Jesus the Son
    And give Him the glory great things He hath done.

    2.
    O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
    To ev'ry believer the promise of God;
    The vilest offender who truly believes,
    That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
    And great our rejoicing thro' Jesus the Son;
    But purer, and higher, and greater will be
    Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.  [Chorus]

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE4%2Dkb_5cb0YOgexGSgcD5UjrOs9Fnuc/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    My heart was distress'd neath Jehovah's dread frown,
    And low in the pit where my sins dragg'd me down;
    I cried to the Lord from the deep miry clay,
    Who tenderly brought me out to golden day.

    Chorus:
    He brought me out of the miry clay,
    He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
    He puts a song in my soul to-day,
    A song of praise, hallelujah!

    2.
    He placed me upon the strong Rock by His side,
    My steps were established and here I'll abide;
    No danger of falling while here I remain,
    But stand by His grace until the crown I gain.  [Chorus]

    3.
    He gave me a song, 'twas a new song of praise.
    By day and by night its sweet notes I will raise;
    My heart's overflowing, I'm happy and free,
    I'll praise my Redeemer, who has rescued me.  [Chorus]

    4.
    I'll sing of His wonderful mercy to me,
    I'll praise Him till all men His goodness shall see;
    I'll sing of salvation at home and abroad,
    Till many shall hear the truth and trust in God.  [Chorus]

    1.
    O, spread the tidings round,
    Wherever man is found,
    Wherever human hearts 
    And human woes abound;
    Let ev'ry Christian tongue
    Proclaim the joyful sound:
    The Comforter has come.

    Chorus:  
    The Comforter has come,

    The Holy Ghost from heav'n,
    The Father's promise giv'n;
    O, spread the tidings round,
    Wherever man is found,
    The Comforter has come!

    2.
    The long, long night is past,
    The morning breaks at last;
    And hush'd the dreadful wail
    And fury of the blast,
    As o'er the golden hills
    The day advances fast:
    The Comforter has come!  [Chorus]

    3.
    Behold, the King of kings,
    With healing in his wings,
    To ev'ry captive soul
    A full deliv'rance brings;
    And thro' the vacant cells
    The song of triumph rings:
    The Comforter has come!  [Chorus]

    4.
    O boundless Love divine!
    How shall this tongue of mine
    To wond'ring mortals tell
    The matchless grace divine,
    That I, a child of sin,
    Should in his image shine!  
    The Comforter has come!  [Chorus]

    5.
    Sing, till the echoes fly
    Above the vaulted sky,
    And all the saints above
    To all below reply,
    In strains of endless love,
    The song that ne'er will die:
    The Comforter has come!  [Chorus]

    In lofty strains let Zion sing
    The praise of her triumphant King;
    Captivity is captive led,

    1.
    O, the bitter pain and sorrow,
    That a time could ever be,
    When I proudly said to Jesus,
    "All of self and none of Thee!"
    All of self and none of Thee,
    All of self and none of Thee,
    When I proudly said to Jesus, 
    "All of self and none of Thee!"

    2.
    Yet He found me; I beheld Him
    Bleeding on th' accursed tree;
    And my wistful heart said faintly,
    "Some of self and some of Thee,"
    Some of self and some of Thee,
    Some of self and some of Thee,
    And my wistful heart said faintly,
    "Some of self and some of Thee!"

    3.
    Day by day His tender mercy,
    Healing, helping, full and free,
    Brought me lower, while I whispered,
    "Less of self and more of Thee,"
    Less of self and more of Thee,
    Less of self and more of Thee,
    Brought me lower while I whispered,
    "Less of self and more of Thee!"

    4.
    Higher than the highest heavens,
    Deeper than the deepest sea,
    Lord, Thy love at last has conquered,
    "None of self and all of Thee,
    None of self and all of Thee,
    None of self and all of Thee,
    Lord, Thy love at last has conquered,
    "None of self and all of Thee!"

    1.
    O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,
    Bow down before him, his glory proclaim;
    With gold of obedience, and incense of lowliness,
    Kneel and adore him, the Lord is his name.

    2.
    Low at his feet lay thy burden of carefulness,
    High on his heart he will bear it for thee,
    Comfort thy sorrows, and answer thy prayerfulness,
    Guiding thy steps as may best for thee be.

    3.
    Fear not to enter his courts in the slenderness
    Of the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine:
    Truth in its beauty, and love in its tenderness,
    These are the off'rings to lay on his shrine.

    4.
    These, tho' we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,
    He will accept for the Name that is dear;
    Mornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,
    Trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.

    Jesus, has died for me;
    Firm on the Rock of Ages,

    Wait till the night is o'er;
    Wait till I see the morning
    Break on the golden shore.  [Refrain]

    Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
    The way into heaven could not thus be bought;
    The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
    The death of my Saviour redemption hath wrought.  [Chorus]

    Chorus:
    O there's music, sweetest music,
    There's music in the name of Jesus;
    O there's music, heav'nly music,
    With Jesus in my soul.

    How cheering is the voice of heav'nly melody!
    How diff'rent is the world's complaining!
    And we may make the choice of what this life shall be,
    With promise of the life remaining.  [Chorus]

    3.
    When we are dead to Self, then are we dead to sin;

    With Self there is no room for Jesus.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Don't bind the giant down, nor lay him on the shelf,
    Nor leave him dead on Sini's mountain;
    There's only one sure way to ride the heart of Self,
    A burial deep in Calv'ry's fountain.  [Chorus]

    5.
    Then Love begins her life of work, and song, and prayer,
    With not a moment lost in sighing;
    To save a dying world, is all her tho't and care
    For love is more than self denying.  [Chorus]

## 235.  '"A New Song"'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lFYrOmFfvA1RmzzK7OfIwh4pAggtW44P/edit?mode=html)



    O sing unto the Lord a new song;
    for he hath done marv'lous things;
    his right hand, and his holy arm
    hath gotten him the victory.

    The Lord hath made known his salvation:
    his righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the heathen.
    He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel.
    All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

    Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth,
    make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise.
    Sing unto the Lord with the harp;
    with the harp and the voice of a psalm.

    With trumpets and sound of cornet
    make a joyful noise before the Lord, the King.
    Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
    the world and they that dwell therein.

    Let the floods clap their hands; let the hills be joyful together before the Lord;
    for he cometh to judge the earth:
    with righteousness shall he judge the world,
    and the people with equity.

    1.
    I sing the love of God, my Father,
    Whose Spirit abides within,
    Who changes all my grief to gladness,
    And pardons me all my sin.
    Tho' clouds may lower, dark and dreary,
    Yet He has promised to be near;
    He gives me sunshine for my shadow,
    And "beauty for ashes," here. 
    He gives me joy in place of sorrow;
    He gives me love that casts out fear;
    He gives me sunshine for my shadow,
    And "beauty for ashes," here.

    2.
    I sing the love of Christ, my Saviour,
    Who suffer'd upon the tree,
    That in the secret of His presence,
    My bondage might freedom be.
    He comes "to bind the broken hearted;"
    He comes the fainting soul to cheer;
    He gives me "oil of joy" for mourning,
    And "beauty for ashes," here.
    He gives me joy in place of sorrow;
    He gives me love that casts out fear;
    He gives me sunshine for my shadow,
    And "beauty for ashes," here.

    3.
    I sing the beauty of the Gospel
    That scatters not thorns, but flow'rs,
    That bids me scatter smiles and sunbeams
    Wherever are lonely hours.
    The "garment of His praise" it offers
    For "heaviness of spirit," drear;
    It gives me sunshine for my shadow,
    And "beauty for ashes," here.
    He gives me joy in place of sorrow;
    He gives me love that casts out fear;
    He gives me sunshine for my shadow,
    And "beauty for ashes," here.

    From His word now courage borrow,
    Jesus carries all your sorrow, 
    O how He loves!

    4.
    Thro' His name we are forgiven,
    O how He loves!
    Backward shall our foes be driven,
    O how He loves!
    Best of blessings He'll provide us,
    Naught but good shall e'er betide us,
    Safe to glory He will guide us,
    O how He loves!

    From my heart, and now he keeps me by his pow'r.
    Tho' all the world forsake me, and Satan tempts me sore,
    Thro' Jesus I shall safely reach the goal.

    With his manna he my hungry soul doth fill.
    Then sweeping up to glory, I'll see his blessed face,
    Where rivers of delight shall ever roll.
    He's the Lily of the Valley, the bright and Morning Star;
    He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul!

    1.
    Little stars that twinkle in the heaven's blue,
    I have often wondered if you ever knew,
    How there 'rose one like you, leading wise old men
    From the East, thro' Judah, down to Bethlehem.

    2.
    Did you see the costly presents they had bro't?
    Did you see the stable they in wonder sought?
    Did you see the worship tenderly they paid
    To that stranger baby in the manger laid?

    3.
    Did you hear the mothers pleading thro' their tears
    For the babies that Herod slew the coming years?
    Did you see how Joseph, warn'd of God in dreams,
    Hurried into Egypt guided by your beams?

    4.
    Did you watch the Saviour all those years of strife?
    Did you know, for sinners, how he gave his life?
    Little stars that twinkle in the heaven's blue,
    All you saw of Jesus how I wish I knew.

    Wherever thou dost lead.

    2.
    Little eyes might lose the way,
    Little feet might go astray;
    I might weak and weary be,
    But thou art strong for me.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Grief and want may be my foes,
    Foolish sins my way oppose;
    Full of courage I will be,
    Whene'er I follow thee.  [Chorus]

    1.
    Sweetly sing, sweetly sing,
    Praises to our heav'nly King;
    Let us raise, let us raise
    High our notes of praise;
    Praise to Him whose name is Love,
    Praise to Him who reigns above;
    Raise your songs, raise your songs,
    Now with thankful tongues.

    2.
    Angels bright, angels bright,
    Rob'd in garments pure and white,
    Chant his praise, chant his praise
    In melodious lays;
    But from that bright, happy throng,
    Ne'er can come this sweetest song,
    "Pard'ning love, pard'ning love,
    Brought us here above."

    3.
    Far away, far away,
    We in sin's dark valley lay,
    Jesus came, Jesus came,
    Blessed be his name;
    He redeem'd us by his grace,
    Then prepar'd in heav'n a place
    To receive, to receive,
    All who will believe.

    My ransom from the dreadful guilt
    Of sin and wrath divine!
    I'd sing his glorious righteousness,
    In which all perfect heav'nly dress
    My soul shall ever shine,
    My soul shall ever shine.

    3.
    I'd sing the character he bears,
    And all the forms of love he wears,
    Exalted on his throne;
    In loftiest songs of sweetest praise,
    I would to everlasting days
    Make all his glories known,
    Make all his glories known.

    4.
    Well, the delightful day will come,
    When my dear Lord will take me home,
    And I shall see his face;

    Did the guiding star behold;
    As with joy they hailed its light,
    Leading onward, beaming bright;
    So, most gracious Lord, may we
    Evermore be led to Thee.

    2.
    As with joyful steps they sped
    To that lowly manger bed,
    There to bend the knee before
    Him whom heav'n and earth adore;
    So may we with willing feet
    Ever seek the mercy-seat.

    3.
    As they offered gifts most rare
    At that manger rude and bare;
    So may we with holy joy,
    Pure, and free from sin's alloy,
    All our costliest treasures bring,
    Christ, to Thee, our heav'nly King.

    4.
    Holy Jesus, ev'ry day
    Keep us in the narrow way;
    And, when earthly things are past,
    Bring our ransomed souls at last
    Where they need no star to guide,
    Where no clouds Thy glory hide.

    Yea, we know Thy love rejoices
    O'er each work of Thine;

    Craftsman's art and music's measure
    For Thy pleasure  Didst design.

    4.
    Here, great God, today we offer
    Of Thine own to Thee;
    And for Thine acceptance proffer,

    Hearts and minds, and hands and voices,
    In our choicest Melody.  Amen.

    I journey o'er the plain,
    And in the sunlight of His love
    I reap the golden grain.  [Chorus]

    Soon I shall see Him as He is,
    The Light that came to me;
    Behold the brightness of His face
    Thro'out eternity.  [Chorus]
 
 

## 277.  Brightest and Best
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kMPCyEwZVWWYIQ5NXmbFHWNP_N23fVpY/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,
    Dawn on our darkness, and lend us Thine aid;
    Star of the East, the horizon adorning,
    Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid.

    2.
    Cold on His cradle the dewdrops are shining;
    Low lies His head with the beasts of the stall;
    Angels adore Him, in slumber reclining.
    Maker, and Monarch, and Saviour of all.

    3.
    Tho' we should yield Him, in costly devotion,
    Odors of Edom and off'rings divine,
    Gems of the mountain, and pearls of the ocean,
    Myrrh from the forest, and gold from the mine,

    4.
    Vainly we offer each ample oblation,
    Vainly with gifts would His favor secure;
    Richer by far is the heart's adoration,
    Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.

    And our path more light.  [Chorus]

    While within Thy courts we stay.

    4.
    Thou our years of toil hast blest,
    Ever given what was best;
    May the future hold in store
    Cups of service running o'er.
    Bless us with Thy peace today,
    While within Thy courts we stay.

    More love to thee!
    More love to thee!

    No tears but may vanish on his loving breast,
    No tears but may vanish on his loving breast.

    4.
    O Crucified Jesus!  of thee will I sing,
    My blessed Redeemer, my God and my King;
    My soul fill'd with rapture, shall shout o'er the grave;
    In him will I triumph, the "Mighty to Save!"  
    In him will I triumph, the "Mighty to Save!"

    1.
    My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine,
    For thee all the follies of sin I resign;
    My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art thou;
    If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

    2.
    I love thee, because thou hast first loved me,
    And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
    I love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow;
    If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

    3.
    I'll love thee in life, and I'll love thee in death;
    I'll praise thee as long as thou lendest me breath,
    And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow,
    If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

    4.
    In mansions of glory and endless delight,
    I'll ever adore thee in heaven so bright,
    And sing with the glittering crown on my brow,
    If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

    1.
    When softly falls the twilight hour,
    O'er moor and mountain, field and flow'r,
    How sweet to leave a world of care,
    And lift to heav'n the voice of pray'r!

    2.
    In solemn midnight's silence deep,
    When Nature's voice is hush'd in sleep,
    Then heavy hearts with grief oppress'd
    May find in pray'r the sweetest rest.

    3.
    And when with red'ning blush of morn
    The newborn day begins to dawn,
    Then upward to the mercy-seat
    Let pray'r ascend like incense sweet.

    4.
    When midday's burning heat we feel,
    When daily cares our hearts would steal,
    O, then to heav'n we look away,
    And find in pray'r our surest stay.

    Tell me the old, old story:
    Christ Jesus makes thee whole.  [Chorus]

    Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
    There is room in my heart for Thee!

    I lay my sins on Jesus,
    The spotless Lamb of God;
    He bears them all, and frees us
    From the accursed load.

    To watch the crimson stains
    White in His blood most precious,
    Till not one spot remains.

    2.
    I lay my wants on Jesus;
    All fullness dwells in Him;
    He heals all my diseases,
    He doth my soul redeem:
    I lay my griefs on Jesus,
    My burdens and my cares,
    He from them all releases,
    He all my sorrow shares.

    3.
    I long to be like Jesus,
    Meek, loving, lowly, mild;
    I long to be like Jesus,
    The Father's holy child:

    Amid the heav'nly throng,
    To sing with them His praises,
    To learn the angel's song.

    Or chafings at Thy dealings,
    Or tho'ts of vain regret;

    But restful, calm and pliant,
    From bend and bias free,
    Awaiting Thy decision,
    When thou hast need of me.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VC5oQZxXXHwPuYs8NpAsfZT_3SY302JQ/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Jesus, I have promised
    To serve Thee to the end;
    Be Thou forever near me,
    My Master and my Friend;
    I shall not fear the battle
    If Thou art by my side,
    Nor wander from the pathway
    If Thou wilt be my Guide.

    2.
    O let me feel Thou near me,
    The world is ever near;
    I see the sights that dazzle,
    The tempting sounds I hear;
    My foes are ever near me,
    Around me and within;
    But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,
    And shield my soul from sin.

    3.
    O Jesus, Thou hast promised
    To all who follow Thee
    That where Thou art in glory
    There shall Thy servant be;
    And, Jesus, I have promised
    To serve Thee to the end;
    O give me grace to follow
    My Master and my Friend.
 
 

## 320.  God Loves Us
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VZBDAt3%2D3430dM7kOJ%2DvksrpPqgkTiFv/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How dearly God doth love us,
    And this poor world of ours,
    To spread blue skies above us,
    And deck the earth with flow'rs!
    There's not a blossom lowly,
    Nor bird that cleaves the air,
    But tells, in accents holy,
    His kindness and his care.

    2.
    He bids the sun to warm us,
    And light the path we tread;
    At night, lest aught should harm us,
    He guards our lowly bed.
    He gives our needful clothing,
    And sends our daily food;
    His love denies us nothing
    His wisdom deemeth good.

    3.
    The Bible, too, he gave us,
    That tells how Jesus came,
    Whose word can save and cleanse us
    From guilt and sin and shame.
    O may God's mercies move us
    To serve him with our pow'rs;
    For O, how he doth love us,
    And this poor world of ours!
 
 

## 321.  We Worship Thee
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SNpMzUvVDoZlBPxHMAZZ3EqgA9kXe7cQ/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Saviour, precious Saviour,
    Whom yet unseen we love,
    O Name of might and favor,
    All other names above!
    We worship Thee, we bless Thee,
    To thee, O Christ, we sing;
    We praise thee, and confess Thee
    Our holy Lord and King.

    2.
    O bringer of salvation,
    Who wondrously hast wrought,
    Thyself the revelation 
    Of love beyond our tho't,
    We worship Thee, we bless Thee,
    To Thee, O Christ, we sing;
    We praise Thee, and confess Thee
    Our gracious Lord and King.

    3.
    In Thee all fulness dwelleth,
    All grace and pow'r divine;
    The glory that excelleth,
    O Son of God is Thine;
    We worship Thee, we bless thee,
    To thee, O Christ, we sing;
    We praise Thee, and confess Thee
    Our glorious Lord and King.

    4.
    Oh, grant the consummation
    Of this our song above,
    In endless adoration,
    And everlasting love;
    Then shall we praise and bless Thee
    Where perfect praises ring,
    And evermore confess Thee
    Our Saviour and our King.
 
 

## 322.  Word of God Incarnate
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SpZX5mB2z5UjivHoOtFP9ZKjmI8W0wOq/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Word of God incarnate,
    O Wisdom from on high,
    O Truth unchanged, unchanging,
    O Light of our dark sky!
    We praise Thee for the radiance
    That from the hallow'd page,
    A lamp to guide our footsteps,
    Shine on from age to age.

    2.
    The Church from her dear Master
    Received the gift divine,
    And still that light she lifteth
    O'er all the earth to shine;
    It is the golden casket
    Where gems of truth are stored,
    It is the heav'n drawn picture
    Of Christ, the living Word.

    3.
    It floateth like a banner
    Before God's host unfurled:
    It shineth like a beacon
    Above the darkling world;
    It is the chart and compass
    That o'er life's surging sea,
    Mid mists and rocks and quicksands,
    Still guides, O Christ, to Thee.

    4.
    O make Thy Church, dear Saviour,
    A lamp of purest gold,
    To bear before the nations
    Thy true light as of old;
    O teach Thy wand'ring pilgrims
    By this their path to trace,
    Till, clouds and darkness ended,
    They see Thee face to face.  Amen.
 
 

## 323.  'Children''s Praises'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sn8fiwz8q1grvqLVJQfpGShIvT5V9lPH/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    When, His salvation bringing,
    To Zion Jesus came,
    The children all stood singing
    "Hosanna" to his name.
    Nor did their zeal offend him,
    But, as he rode along,
    He let them still attend him
    And smiled to hear their song.

    2.
    And, since the Lord retaineth
    His love for children still,
    Tho' now as King he reigneth
    On Zion's heav'nly hill,
    We'll flock around his banner,
    Who sits upon the throne,
    And cry aloud, "Hosanna
    To David's royal Son."

    3.
    For, should we fail proclaiming
    Our great Redeemer's praise,
    These stones, our silence shaming,
    Would their hosannas raise.
    But shall we only render
    The tribute of our words?
    Nor, while our hearts are tender,
    They too shall be the Lord's.
 
 

## 324.  Praise to Jesus
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S_up7T8LuNR6CYA3H2cagyf4qn2LJgZG/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Come, praise your Lord and Saviour,
    In strains of holy mirth;
    Give thanks to him, O children,
    Who lived a child on earth.
    He loved the little children
    And call'd them to his side,
    His loving arms embraced them,
    And for their sake he died.

    2.
    Let boyhood loudly praise thee
    With songs of holy joy,
    For thou on earth didst sojourn,
    A pure and spotless boy.
    Make us like thee obedient,
    Like thee from evil free;
    Like thee in God's own temple;
    In happy home like thee.

    3.
    In thee all gentlest graces
    Are gathered into one.
    O give that best adornment
    Which Christian maid can wear,
    The meek and quiet spirit,
    Which shone in thee so fair.

    4.
    To thee, with voices blended,
    We sing our songs of praise:
    Be thou the light and pattern
    Of all our childhood days;
    And lead us ever onward,
    That, while we stay below,
    We may like thee, O Jesus,
    In grace and wisdom grow.
 
 

## 325.  The Voice Within
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TtNe%2DTSzbsy89qWYi2RYA5OdqU569P8f/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There lives a voice within me,
    Guest angel of my heart,
    Whose whisp'rings strive to win me
    To act a noble part.
    Up evermore it springeth
    Like some sweet melody.
    And evermore it singeth
    This song of songs to me:

    Chorus:
    This world is full of beauty,
    That points the soul above,
    And if we did our duty,
    It might be full of love.

    2.
    The leaf tongues of the forest,
    The flower lips of the sod,
    The birds that hymn their raptures
    Up to the throne of God;
    The summer wind that bringeth
    Joy over land and sea.
    Have each a voice that singeth
    This song of songs to me:  [Chorus]

    3.
    O voice of God most tender,
    O voice of God divine,
    Still be my heart's defender
    Till ev'ry tho't is Thine;
    My soul in gladness bringeth
    Its songs of praise to Thee,
    While all around me singeth
    This song of songs to me:  [Chorus]
 
 

## 326.  Saviour Mine
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TuF%2DwLypBe31S__%2D9WQSxoAXO0AhMqAz/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    To Thee, O dear, dear Saviour!
    My spirit turns for rest,
    My peace is in Thy favor,
    My pillow on Thy breast;
    Tho' all the world deceive me,
    I know that I am Thine,
    And Thou wilt never leave me,
    O blessed Saviour mine.

    2.
    In Thee my trust abideth,
    On Thee my hope relies,
    O Thou whose love provideth
    For all beneath the skies;
    It was Thy mercy found me,
    From bondage set me free,
    And then for ever bound me
    With threefold cords to Thee.

    3.
    My grief is in the dullness
    With which this sluggish heart
    Doth open to the fullness
    Of all Thou wouldst impart;
    My hope is in Thy beauty
    Of holiness divine,
    My joy is in the duty
    That binds my life in Thine.  Amen
 
 

## 327.  'Holy, Holy'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TvuKDH1PEGInBtwTf5YmqEEhUPoMPBQL/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Holy, holy, holy!  Lord God Almighty!
    Early in the morning our song shall rise to thee;
    Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
    ==God over all, who rules eternity.==

    2.
    Holy, holy, holy!  angels adore thee,
    Casting down their bright crowns around the glassy sea;
    Thousands and ten thousands worship low before thee,
    Which wert and art and evermore shalt be.

    3.
    Holy, holy, holy!  though darkness hide thee,
    Though the eye of man thy great glory may not see;
    Only thou art holy; there is none beside thee,
    Perfect in power, in love and purity.
 
 

## 328.  Worthy Is the Lamb
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ShYYDGvCt2B_%2Dzwg39PjUlRkSByyS%2DxJ/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Worthy, worthy, is the Lamb,
    Worthy, worthy is the Lamb;
    Worthy, worthy is the Lamb
    That was slain.

    Chorus:
    Glory, hallelujah!  
    Praise him, hallelujah!
    Glory, hallelujah
    To the Lamb!

    2.
    Saviour, let thy kingdom come!
    Now the pow'r of sin consume;
    Bring thy blest millennium,
    Holy Lamb.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Thus may we each moment feel,
    Love him, serve him, praise him still,
    Till we all on Zion's hill
    See the Lamb.  [Chorus]
 
 

## 329.  The Hand That Made Us
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1STV2RLCBnwZqqwuBOUOiSYQgfL0a4fmq/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The spacious firmament on high,
    With all the blue, ethereal sky,
    And spangled heav'ns, a shining frame,
    Their great Original proclaim:
    Th' unwearied sun, from day to day
    Does his Creator's pow'r display,
    And publishes to ev'ry land
    The work of an almighty hand.

    2.
    Soon as the evening shades prevail,
    The moon takes up the wondrous tale;
    And nightly, to the list'ning earth
    Repeats the story of her birth;
    While all the stars that round her burn,
    And all the planets in their turn,
    Confirm the tidings as they roll,
    And spread the truth from pole to pole.

    3.
    What tho' in solemn silence, all
    Move round the dark terrestrial ball?
    What tho' no real voice nor sound
    Amid their radiant orbs be found!
    In reason's ear they all rejoice,
    And utter forth a glorious voice,
    Forever singing as they shine,
    "The hand that made us is divine."
 
 

## 330.  I Sing the Power of God
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tsvo6ta5U_47aJgkclkfUuOGq%2DEpL_HH/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I sing the mighty pow'r of God,
    That made the mountains rise,
    That spread the flowing seas abroad,
    And built the lofty skies;
    I sing the wisdom that ordained
    The sun to rule the day;
    The moon shines full at his command,
    And all the stars obey.

    2.
    I sing the goodness of the Lord,
    That filled the earth with food;
    He formed the creatures with his word,
    And then pronounced them good.
    Lord, how thy wonders are displayed
    Where'er I turn my eye!
    If I survey the ground I tread,
    Or gaze upon the sky!

    3.
    There's not a plant or flow'r below
    But makes thy glories known;
    And clouds arise, and tempests blow,
    By order from thy throne.
    Creatures that borrow life from thee
    Are subject to thy care;
    There's not a place where we can flee
    But God is present there.
 
 

## 331.  'How Can I Keep From Singing?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QCa2EVCjYiN6yMdMLdv056qUHdD6i939/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    My life flows on in endless song;
    Amid earth's lamentation,
    I hear the sweet, tho' far-off hymn
    That hails a new creation;
    Thro' all the tumult and the strife
    I hear the music ringing;
    It finds an echo in my soul,
    How can I keep from singing?

    2.
    What tho' my joys and comforts die,
    The Lord my Helper liveth!
    What tho' the darkness gather round;
    Songs in the night he giveth!
    No storm can shake my inmost calm
    While to that refuge clinging;
    Since God is Lord of heav'n and earth,
    How can I keep from singing?

    3.
    I lift mine eyes; the cloud grows thin;
    I see the blue above it;
    And day by day this pathway smooths
    Since first I learned to love it.
    The peace of God makes fresh my heart,
    A fountain ever springing;
    All things are mine, since I am His
    How can I keep from singing?
 
 

## 332.  'I''ve Found a Friend'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QGtbUXQ45L19CeLvSinxpBsq51hMicu8/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
    He loved me ere I knew Him:
    He drew me with the cords of love,
    And thus He bound me to Him.
    And 'round my heart still closely twine
    These ties which naught can sever,
    For I am His, and He is mine,
    Forever and forever.

    2.
    I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
    He bled, He died to save me;
    And not alone the gift of life,
    But His own self He gave me.
    Naught that I have my own I call,
    I hold it for the Giver;
    My heart, my strength, my life, my all,
    Are His, and His forever.

    3.
    I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
    All pow'r to Him is given;
    To guard me on my upward course,
    And bring me safe to heaven.
    Th' eternal glories gleam afar,
    To nerve my faint endeavor;
    So now to watch, to work, to war,
    And then to rest forever.

    4.
    I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
    So kind, and true, and tender,
    So wise a Counselor and Guide,
    So mighty a Defender.
    From Him, who loveth me so well,
    What pow'r my soul can sever?
    Shall life or death, or earth or hell?
    No; I am His forever.
 
 

## 333.  Lord of All Being
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QgcEY_JIyED1V5HI1_nOhH2YgCGnK2Wh/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Lord of all being, throned afar,
    Thy glory flames from sun and star,
    Center and soul of ev'ry sphere,
    Yet to each loving heart how near!
    Yet to each loving heart how near!

    2.
    Sun of our life, Thy quick'ning ray
    Sheds on our path the glow of day;
    Star of our hope, Thy softened light
    Cheers the long watches of the night.
    Cheers the long watches of the night.

    3.
    Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn,
    Our noontide is thy gracious dawn,
    Our rainbow arch Thy mercy's sign,
    All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine.
    All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine.

    4.
    Lord of all life, below, above,
    Whose light is truth, whose warmth is love,
    Before Thy ever-blazing throne
    We ask no luster of our own.
    We ask no luster of our own.

    5.
    Grant us Thy truth to make us free,
    And kindling hearts that burn for Thee,
    Till all Thy living altars claim
    One holy light, one heav'nly flame!
    One holy light, one heav'nly flame.
 
 

## 334.  For Us
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QGixQC0QOVoWXuzbUvvtfvDs7ypnsA7U/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Love!  how deep, how broad, how high!
    It fills the heart with ecstacy,
    That God, the Son of God, should take
    Our mortal form for mortals' sake.

    2.
    For us He was baptized, and bore 
    His holy fast, and hungered sore;
    For us temptations sharp He knew;
    For us the tempter overthrew.

    3.
    For us He prayed, for us He taught,
    For us His daily works He wrought,
    By words, and signs, and actions thus
    Still seeking not Himself but us.

    4.
    For us to wicked men betrayed,
    Scourged, mocked, purple robe arrayed,
    He bore the shameful cross and death;
    For us at length gave up His breath.

    5.
    For us He rose from death again,
    For us He went on high to reign,
    For us He sent His Spirit here
    To guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.

    6.
    To Him whose boundless love has won
    Salvation for us through His Son,
    To God the Father, glory be,
    Both now and through eternity.

    1.
    O worship the King, all glorious above,
    And gratefully sing his wonderful love;
    Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,
    Pavilion'd in splendor, and girded with praise.

    2.
    O tell of his might and sing of his grace,
    Whose robe is the light; whose canopy, space;
    His chariots of wrath the deep thunder clouds form,
    And dark is his path on the wings of the storm.

    3.
    Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite?
    It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;
    It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,
    And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.

    4.
    Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,
    In Thee do we trust, nor find thee to fail;
    Thy mercies, how tender!  how firm to the end!
    Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QI5KbRoQDg%2DzNV5wqrOjXVa7P6%2DSprxP/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,
    On whom in affliction I call,
    My comfort by day and my song in the night,
    My hope, my salvation, my all!

    2.
    His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,
    Is heard thro' the shadows of death;
    The cedars of Lebanon bow at his feet,
    The air is perfum'd with his breath.

    3.
    His lips, as a fountain of righteousness flow,
    To water the gardens of grace;
    From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,
    And bask in the smiles of his face.

    4.
    He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,
    And myriads wait for his word;
    He speaks, and eternity, fill'd with his voice,
    Reechoes the praise of the Lord.
 
 

## 337.  Psalm of Praise
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QiH%2DGVzi0I1w4fwB6CGeHrO4zEUCAV3Q/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God's free mercy streameth
    Over all the world,
    And His banner gleameth,
    By His church unfurled;
    Broad and deep and glorious,
    As the heav'n above,
    Shines in might victorious
    His eternal love.

    2.
    Summer suns are glowing
    Over land and sea;
    Happy light is flowing,
    Bountiful and free;
    Evrything rejoices 
    In the mellow rays;
    Earth's ten thousand voices
    Swell the psalm of praise.

    3.
    Lord, upon our blindness,
    Thy pure radiance pour;
    For Thy loving kindness
    We would love Thee more;
    And when clouds are drifting
    Dark across the sky,
    Then, the vail uplifting,
    Father, be Thou nigh.

    4.
    We will never doubt Thee,
    Tho' Thou vail Thy light;
    Life is dark without Thee,
    Death with Thee is bright;
    Light of light, shine o'er us
    On our pilgrim way,
    Go Thou still before us
    To the endless day.

    1.
    Purer yet and purer
    I would be in mind,
    Dearer yet and dearer
    Ev'ry duty find;
    Hoping still and trusting
    God without a fear,
    Patiently believing
    He will make all clear.

    2.
    Calmer yet and calmer
    In the hours of pain,
    Surer yet and surer
    Peace at last to gain;
    Suff'ring still and doing,
    To His will resigned,
    And to God subduing
    Heart and will and mind.

    3.
    Higher yet and higher
    Out of clouds and night,
    Nearer yet and nearer
    Rising to the light
    Light serene and holy,
    Where my soul may rest,
    Purified and lowly,
    Sanctified and blest.

    4.
    Swifter yet and swifter
    Ever onward run,
    Firmer yet and firmer
    Step as I go on;
    Oft these earnest longings
    Swell within my breast,
    Yet their inner meaning
    Ne'er can be express'd.  Amen.

    1.
    Day is dying in the west;
    Heav'n is touching earth with rest:
    Wait and worship while the night
    Sets her evening lamps alight
    Thro' all the sky.

    Chorus:
    Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!
    Heav'n and earth are full of Thee!
    Heav'n and earth are praising Thee,
    O Lord most high.

    2.
    Lord of Life, beneath the dome
    Of the universe, thy home,
    Gather us, who seek Thy face,
    To the fold of Thy embrace,
    For Thou art nigh.  [Chorus]

    3.
    While the deep'ning shadows fall,
    Heart of Love, enfold us all;
    Thro' the glory and the grace
    Of the stars that veil thy face,
    Our hearts ascend.  [Chorus]

    4.
    When forever from our sight,
    Pass the stars, the day, the night,
    Lord of angels, on our eyes
    Let eternal morning rise,
    And shadows end.  [Chorus]
 
 

## 340.  Saviour and Friend
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q9XIXtivpSPW7dP19wByZNuGxX3EkG7t/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Rest of the weary, 
    Joy of the sad,
    Hope of the dreary, 
    Light of the glad;
    Home of the stranger, 
    Strength to the end,
    Refuge from danger, 
    Saviour and Friend;
    Refuge from danger, 
    Saviour and Friend,
    Saviour and Friend.

    2.
    Pillow where lying, 
    Love rests her head;
    Peace of the dying, 
    Life of the dead;
    Path of the lowly,
    Prize at the end,
    Breath of the holy,
    Saviour and Friend;
    Breath of the holy, 
    Saviour and Friend,
    Saviour and Friend.

    3.
    When my feet stumble,
    To Thee I cry;
    Crown of the humble, 
    Cross of the high;
    When my steps wander,
    Over me bend,
    Truer and fonder,
    Saviour and Friend;
    True and fonder,
    Saviour and Friend,
    Saviour and Friend.

    4.
    Ever confessing Thee,
    I will raise
    Unto Thee blessing,
    Glory, and praise;
    All my endeavor,
    World without end,
    Thine to be ever,
    Saviour and Friend;
    Thine to be ever,
    Saviour and Friend,
    Saviour and Friend.
 
 

## 341.  Thy Glory Fills the Heavens
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SK5YGXJ07ImBjDp_wwJTLzULMt8Y5ira/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Lord, thy glory fills the heaven;
    Earth is with its fulness stored;
    Unto thee be glory given,
    Holy, holy, holy Lord!
    Heav'n is still with anthems ringing;
    Earth takes up the angel's cry,
    Holy, holy, holy, singing,
    Lord of hosts, thou Lord most high.

    2.
    Ever thus in God's high praises,
    Brethren, let our tongues unite;
    While our tho't his greatness raises,
    And our love his gifts excite:
    With his seraph train before him,
    With his holy church below,
    Thus unite we to adore him,
    Bid we thus our anthem flow.

    3.
    Lord, thy glory fills the heaven,
    Earth is with its fulness stored;
    Unto thee be glory given,
    Holy, holy, holy Lord!
    Thus thy glorious name confessing,
    We adopt the angel's cry,
    Holy, holy, holy, blessing 
    Thee, the Lord our God most high!
 
 

## 342.  Ten Thousand Harps
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Re56VDQzX0gxXLJZOtikH9plibjQ7RYh/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Hark!  ten thousand harps and voices
    Sound the note of praise above;
    Jesus reigns, and heav'n rejoices;
    Jesus reigns, the God of love;
    See, he sits on yonder throne;
    Jesus rules the world alone.
    Hallelujah!  hallelujah!  hallelujah! amen.

    2.
    King of glory, reign forever,
    Thine an everlasting crown;
    Nothing from thy love shall sever
    Those whom thou dost seal thine own;
    Happy objects of thy grace,
    Destined to behold thy face.
    Hallelujah!  hallelujah!  hallelujah!  amen.

    3.
    Saviour, hasten thine appearing;
    Bring, O bring, the glorious day
    When the awful summons bearing, 
    Heav'n and earth shall pass away!
    Then, with golden harps, we'll sing,
    "Glory, glory to our King.
    Hallelujah!  hallelujah!  hallelujah!  amen.
 
 

## 343.  I My Cross Have Taken
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RhJk%2Dux7axU1IQjvp5kl2QM0aTnm1Hrg/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jesus, I my cross have taken,
    All to leave and follow thee;
    All things else I have forsaken,
    Thou henceforth my all shalt be;
    Perish ev'ry fond ambition,
    All I've sought or hoped or known;
    Yet how much is my condition,
    God and heav'n are still my own.

    2.
    Let the world despise and leave me,
    They have left my Saviour, too;
    Human hearts and looks deceive me;
    Thou art faithful, thou art true;
    And, while thou dost smile upon me,
    God of wisdom, love and might,
    Foes may hate, and friends may shun me;
    Show thy face, and all is bright.

    3.
    Hast'ning on from grace to glory,
    Arm'd by faith and wing'd by pray'r;
    Heav'n's eternal day's before me,
    God's own hand is guiding there.
    Soon shall close my earthly mission,
    Swift shall pass these pilgrim days,
    Hope shall change to glad fruition,
    Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.
 
 

## 344.  Happy in Him
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SD%2DLV_YJmT3h6v%2DC13VPiidiP4aG5S6f/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How tedious and tasteless the hours
    When Jesus no longer I see!
    Sweet prospects, sweet birds, and sweet flow'rs,
    Have all lost their sweetness to me;
    The midsummer sun shines but dim,
    The fields strive in vain to look gay;
    But when I am happy in him,
    December's as pleasant as May.

    2.
    His name yields the richest perfume,
    And sweeter than music his voice;
    His presence disperses my gloom,
    And makes all within me rejoice:
    I should, were he always thus nigh,
    Have nothing to wish or to fear;
    No mortal so happy as I,
    My summer would last all the year.

    3.
    My Lord, if indeed I am thine,
    If thou art my Sun and my Song,
    Say, why do I languish and pine?
    And why are my winters so long?
    O drive these dark clouds from my sky,
    Thy soul-cheering presence restore;
    Or take me to thee up on high,
    Where winter and clouds are no more.
 
 

## 345.  Love Divine
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVqf%2D89NARZThu7iC04kofifEUs7zFR9/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Love divine, all love excelling,
    Joy of heav'n to earth come down!
    Fix in us thy humble dwelling;
    All thy faithful mercies crown.
    Jesus, thou art all compassion,
    Pure, unbounded love thou art;
    Visit us with thy salvation;
    Enter ev'ry trembling heart.

    2.
    Breathe, O breathe thy loving Spirit
    Into ev'ry troubled breast!
    Let us all thy grace inherit,
    Let us find thy promised rest.
    Take away our bent to sinning;
    Alpha and Omega be;
    End of faith, as its beginning
    Set out hearts at liberty.

    3.
    Finish then thy new creation;
    Pure and spotless let us be;
    Let us see thy great salvation
    Perfectly restored in thee;
    Changed from glory into glory,
    Till in heav'n we take our place,
    Till we cast our crowns before thee,
    Lost in wonder, love, and praise.
 
 

## 346.  Prayer for the Children
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rj9j7hspPju7HQSSprSzjKOyf8uu8hUj/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Heav'nly Father, send Thy blessing
    On the children gathered here,
    May they all, Thy name confessing,
    Hold Thy truth forever dear;
    May they be like Joseph, loving,
    Dutiful, and kind, and pure,
    And their faith, like Samuel proving,
    Steadfast in the right endure.

    2.
    Holy Saviour, who in meekness
    Came to earth a child to be,
    Guide their steps and help their weakness,
    Bless and make them like to Thee;
    Bear Thy lambs when they are weary,
    Safe upon Thy loving breast,
    Thro' life's desert, dry and dreary,
    Bring them to thy heav'nly rest.

    3.
    Spread Thy golden pinions o'er them,
    Holy Spirit from above;
    Guide them, lead them, go before them,
    Give them peace, and joy, and love;
    Temples of thy glorious Godhead,
    May they with Thy presence shine,
    And immortal bliss inherit,
    And forevermore be Thine.
 
 

## 347.  Holy River
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rqcsz3X5NNJL1ouPoy40crKfqTuZ1bCV/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Fresh from the throne of glory,
    Bright in its crystal gleam,
    Bursts out the living Fountain,
    Swells on the living Stream.

    Refrain:
    Holy River, I would ever
    Draw my life from thee;
    Mighty River, I will never
    Cease to sing of thee.

    2.
    Stream full of life and gladness,
    Spring of all health and peace,
    No harps by thee hang silent,
    Nor happy voices cease.  [Refrain]

    3.
    River of God, I greet thee,
    Now not afar, but near;
    My soul to thy still waters
    Hastes in its thirstings here.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Jesus, the healing Fountain,
    Fresh from the throne above,
    Thou art the living water,
    Thou art the stream of love.  [Refrain]
 
 

## 348.  Little Town of Bethlehem
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RoexzYs9LzMfE8eCZDpgTaSdlOuTO%2DAA/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O little town of Bethlehem,
    How still we see thee lie!
    Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
    The silent stars go by;
    Yet in thy dark streets shineth
    The Everlasting Light;
    The hopes and fears of all the years
    Are met in thee tonight.

    2.
    For Christ is born of Mary;
    And gathered all above,
    While mortals sleep, the angels keep
    Their watch of wond'ring love.
    O morning stars, together
    Proclaim the holy birth!
    And praises sing to God the King,
    And peace to men on earth.

    3.
    How silently, how silently
    The wondrous gift is giv'n!
    So God imparts to human hearts
    The blessings of His heav'n.
    No ear may hear His coming;
    But in this world of sin,
    Where meek souls will receive Him still,
    The dear Christ enters in.

    4.
    O holy Child of Bethlehem,
    Descend to us, we pray;
    Cast out our sin and enter in,
    Be born in us today.
    We hear the Christmas angels
    The great glad tidings tell,
    Oh, come to us, abide with us,
    Our Lord Emmanuel!  Amen.
 
 

## 349.  The Lord in Zion Reigneth
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rc%2DkxByr_Cn66PViNu6DuG7XOi3hYVDe/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The Lord in Zion reigneth!  
    Let all the earth rejoice,
    And come before his throne of grace
    With tuneful heart and voice;
    The Lord in Zion reigneth,
    And there his praise shall ring,
    To him shall princes bend the knee,
    And kings their glory bring.

    2.
    The Lord in Zion reigneth,
    And who so great as he?
    The depths of earth are in his hands,
    He rules the mighty sea;
    O crown his name with honor,
    And let his standard wave,
    Till distant isles beyond the deep
    Shall own his pow'r to save.

    3.
    The Lord in Zion reigneth,
    These hours to him belong,
    O enter now his temple gates,
    And fill his courts with song;
    Beneath his royal banner,
    Let ev'ry creature fall,
    Exalt the King of heav'n and earth,
    "And crown him Lord of all!"
 
 

## 350.  Beneath the Cross
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rw5E9BKS2SaZ6cMqX4pBweyJVrhFIVMU/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Beneath the cross of Jesus
    I fain would take my stand;
    The shadow of a mighty rock
    Within a weary land.
    A home within the wilderness, 
    A rest upon the way,
    From burning of the noontide heat,
    And burdens of the day.

    2.
    Upon that cross of Jesus,
    Mine eye at times can see
    The very dying form of One
    Who suffered there for me.
    And from my smitten heart, with tears,
    Two wonders I confess,
    The wonders of His glorious love,
    And my own worthlessness.

    3.
    I take, O cross, Thy shadow,
    For my abiding place;
    I ask no other sunshine than
    The sunshine of His face:
    Content to let the world go by,
    To know no gain nor loss,
    My sinful self, my only shame,
    My glory, all the cross.
 
 

## 351.  Praise the Lord
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1URvS%2DmPm1CRJGPezAF6ePDBvxzSwyG84/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Praise the Lord, His glories show,
    Saints within His courts below,
    Angels round His throne above,
    All that see and share His love,
    Earth to heav'n and heav'n to earth,
    Tell His wonders, sing His worth;
    Age to age, and shore to shore,
    Praise Him, praise Him evermore.

    2.
    Praise the Lord, His mercies trace;
    Praise His providence and grace,
    All that He for men hath done,
    All He sends us thro' His Son.
    Strings and voices, hands and hearts,
    In the concert bear your parts;
    All that breathe, your Lord adore, 
    Praise Him, praise Him evermore.  Amen.
 
 

## 352.  Freedom in Christ
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UlV6bZa68OU8pF2Tu65lqEGbnIAtMJP8/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Conq'ring kings their titles take
    From the foes they captive make;
    Jesus, by a nobler deed,
    From the thousands He hath freed.
    Yes; none other Name is giv'n
    Unto mortals under heav'n,
    Which can make the dead arise,
    And exalt them to the skies.

    2.
    That which Christ so hardly wrought,
    That which He so dearly bought,
    That salvation, mortals may
    Spurn and madly cast away;
    Rather gladly for that Name
    Bear the cross, endure the shame;
    Joyfully for Him to die
    Is not death, but victory.

    3.
    Jesus, Who dost condescend
    To be called the sinner's Friend,
    Hear us as to Thee, we pray,
    Glorifying in Thy Name today.
    Glory to the Father be,
    Glory, holy Son, to Thee,
    Glory to the Holy Ghost,
    From the saints and angel host.  Amen.
 
 

## 353.  The Herald Angels Sing
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ua0C3zUFZkVDIFCocNdRHsPNxnDWDDpP/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Hark!  the herald angels sing,
    "Glory to the newborn King;
    Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
    God and sinners reconciled!"
    Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
    Join the triumph of the skies;
    With the angel host proclaim,
    "Christ is born in Bethlehem!"
    With the angel host proclaim,
    "Christ is born in Bethlehem!"

    2.
    Christ, by highest heav'n adored,
    Christ, the everlasting Lord;
    In the manger born a king,
    While adoring angels sing,
    "Peace on earth, to men good-will;"
    Bid the trembling soul be still,
    Christ on earth has come to dwell,
    Jesus, our Emmanuel!
    Christ on earth has come to dwell,
    Jesus, our Emmanuel!

    3.
    Hail!  the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
    Hail!  the Sun of righteousness!
    Life, and light to all he brings,
    Ris'n with healing in his wings.
    Mild he lays his glory by,
    Born that man no more may die,
    Born to raise the sons of earth,
    Born to give them second birth.
    Born to raise the sons of earth,
    Born to give them second birth.
 
 

## 354.  Songs of Praise
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UONOieNbz8Kc%2DRIbwBBY7gBX_51a2OsU/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Songs of praise the angels sang;
    Heav'n with alleluias rang,
    When Jehovah;s work begun,
    When he spake and it was done.
    Songs of praise awoke the morn,
    When the Prince of Peace was born;
    Songs of praise arose, when he 
    Captive led captivity.

    2.
    Heav'n and earth shall pass away,
    Songs of praise shall crown that day;
    God will make new heav'n and earth,
    Songs of praise shall hail their birth.
    And can man alone be dumb
    Till that glorious kingdom come?
    No; the Church delights to raise
    Psalms and hymns and songs of praise.

    3.
    Saints below with heart and voice,
    Still in songs of praise rejoice;
    Learning here, by faith and love,
    Songs of praise to sing above.
    Hymns of glory, songs of praise,
    Father, unto thee we raise;
    Jesus, glory unto thee,
    With the Spirit ever be.
 
 

## 355.  The Only Lord
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UeSoJMTrUFdicMZs_XVju_My0bnDipns/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O God, we praise thee, and confess
    That thou the only Lord
    And Everlasting Father art;
    By all be thou adored.
    To thee all angels cry aloud;
    To thee the pow'rs on high,
    Both cherubim and seraphim,
    Continually do cry,

    2.
    "O holy, holy, holy Lord,
    When heav'nly hosts obey,
    The universe is glory fill'd
    With thy majestic's sway!"
    The glad immortal company,
    Arrayed in robes of light,
    With all the saints in sinless worlds,
    Thy constant praise recite.

    3.
    The holy church thro'out the world,
    O Lord, confesses thee,
    That thou th' Eternal Father art,
    Of boundless majesty!
    Thee day by day we magnify,
    Thy mercy we implore,
    To keep us this day without sin,
    And guard us evermore.
 
 

## 356.  'O Love divine, of all that is'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UkpueyBBF5Lap4t5mdPlBY2ihtd63bmB/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Love divine, of all that is,
    The sweetest and the best,
    Fain would I come and rest to-night
    Upon thy tender breast;
    I pray thee turn me not away;
    For, sinful though I be,
    Thou knowest ev'rything I need,
    And all my need of thee.

    2.
    And yet the spirit in my heart
    Says, Wherefore should I pray
    That thou shouldst seek me with thy love,
    Since thou dost seek alway?
    And dost not even wait until
    I urge my steps to thee;
    But in the darkness of my life
    Art coming still to me.

    3.
    Thou hearest ev'ry tho't I mean,
    And not the words I say,
    The hidden thanks among the words
    That only seen to pray.
    Still, still thy love will beckon me,
    And still thy strength will come
    In many ways to bear me up
    And bring me to my home.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U7FIEeSMyh%2DIh6WDE8HbmPHvfdwJlEiD/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Thou who art of all that is
    Beginning and the end,
    We follow thee thro' unknown paths,
    Since all to thee must tend;
    Thy judgments are a mighty deep,
    Beyond all fathom line;
    Our wisdom is the child-like heart;
    Our strength, to trust in thine.

    2.
    We bless thee for the skies above,
    And for the earth beneath;
    For hopes that blossom here below,
    And wither not with death;
    But most ye bless thee for thyself,
    O heavenly Light within,
    Whose dayspring in our hearts, dispels
    The darkness of our sin.
 
 

## 358.  'I heard a voice, the sweetest voice'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U6FrvNYew_c5dRXcs4vNi08REWIGWFzo/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I heard a voice, the sweetest voice
    That ever mortal heard;
    O how it made my heart rejoice,
    And every feeling stirred!
    'Twas Jesus spoke to me so mild;
    He called me to his side,
    And said, although with heart defiled,
    I might in him confide.

    2.
    I saw his face, the fairest face
    That ever mortal saw;
    I longed the Saviour to embrace,
    From him new life to draw.
    "Come unto me," he kindly said,
    "And I will give thee rest;
    The ransom-price I fully paid;
    Repent!  believe!  be blest!"

    3.
    I felt his love, the strongest love
    That mortal ever felt;
    O, how it drew my soul above,
    And made my hard heart melt!
    My burden at his feet I laid,
    And knew the joy of heaven,
    As in my willing ear he said
    The blessed word, "Forgiven!"
 
 

## 359.  The Voice of Jesus
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U5zeH5l8zQxZAL_kVUV7HamDuihJkVUR/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    "Come unto me and rest;
    Lay down; thou weary one lay down
    Thy head upon my breast."
    I came to Jesus as I was
    Weary, and worn, and sad;
    I found in him a resting place,
    And he has made me glad.

    2.
    I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
    "Behold, I freely give
    The living water; thirsty one,
    Stoop down and drink and live."
    I came to Jesus, and I drank
    Of that life-giving stream;
    My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
    And now I live in him.

    3.
    I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    "I am this dark world's light.
    Look unto me; thy morn shall rise,
    And all thy days be bright."
    I look'd to Jesus, and I found
    In him my star, my sun;
    And in that light of life I'll walk,
    Till all my journey's done.

    Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
    Thy head upon My breast;
    I came to Jesus as I was,
    Weary and worn and sad;
    I found in Him a resting place,
    And He has made me glad.

    2.
    I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    "Behold, I freely give
    The living water; thirsty one,
    Stoop down, and drink, and live!"
    I came to Jesus, and I drank
    Of that life-giving stream;
    My thirst was quench'd, my soul revived,
    And now I live in Him.

    3.
    I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    "I am this dark world's light;
    Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
    And all Thy day be bright!"
    I looked to Jesus, and I found
    In Him my Star, my Sun;
    And in that light of life I'll walk,
    Till all my journey's done.
 
 

## 361.  Majestic Sweetness
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PtpfvinsGDXR2DDT4z7vWLk5UuT97Ocw/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Majestic sweetness sits enthron'd
    Upon the Saviour's brow;
    His head with radiant light is crown'd,
    His lips with grace o'erflow,
    His lips with grace o'erflow.

    2.
    No mortal can with him compare,
    Among the sons of men;
    Fairer is he than all the fair
    That fill the heav'nly train,
    That fill the heav'nly train.

    3.
    He saw me plung'd in deep distress,
    He flew to my relief;
    For me he bore the shameful cross,
    And carried all my grief,
    And carried all my grief.

    4.
    To him I owe my life and breath,
    And all the joys I have;
    He makes me triumph over death,
    He saves me from the grave,
    He saves me from the grave.

    5.
    To heaven, the place of his abode,
    He brings my weary feet;
    Shows me the glories of my God,
    And makes my joy complete.

    6.
    Since from his bounty I receive
    Such proofs of love divine,
    Had I a thousand hearts to give,
    Lord, they should all be thine.

    1.
    A glory in the word we find
    When grace restores our sight;
    But sin has darkened all the mind,
    And vail'd the heav'nly light.
    And vail'd the heav'nly light.

    2.
    When God's own Spirit clears our view,
    How bright the doctrines shine!
    Their holy fruits and sweetness show
    The author is divine.
    The author is divine.

    3.
    How blest are we, with open face
    To view thy glory, Lord,
    And all thy image here to trace,
    Reflected in thy word!
    Reflected in thy word!

    4.
    O teach us, as we look, to grow
    In holiness and love,
    That we may long to see and know
    Thy glorious face above.

    2.
    The Spirit breathes upon the word,
    And brings the truth to sight;
    Precepts and promises afford
    A sanctifying light.
    A sanctifying light.

    3.
    The hand that gave it, still supplies
    The gracious light and heat;
    His truths upon the nations rise,
    They rise, but never set.
    They rise, but never set.

    4.
    Let everlasting thanks be thine,
    For such a bright display;
    It makes a world of darkness shine
    With beams of heav'nly day.

    How shall the young secure their hearts,
    And guard their lives from sin?
    Thy word the choicest rules imparts,

    That guides me all the day:
    And thro' the dangers of the night,
    A lamp to lead my way.
    A lamp to lead the way.

    3.
    Thy precepts make me truly wise;
    I hate the sinner's road;
    I hate my own vain thoughts that rise,
    But love thy law, my God.
    But love thy law, my God.

    4.

    1.
    Let all the heathen writers join
    To form one perfect book;
    Great God, if once compared with thine,
    How mean their writings look!
    How mean their writings look!

    2.
    Not the most perfect rules they gave
    Could show one sin forgiv'n,
    Nor lead one step beyond the grave;
    But thine conducts to heaven.
    But thine conducts to heaven.

    3.
    Yet men would fain be just with God
    By works their hands have wrought;
    But thy commands, exceeding broad,
    Extend to every thought.
    Extend to every thought.

    4.
    Our faith, and love, and every grace,
    Fall far below thy word;
    But perfect truth and righteousness
    Dwell only in the Lord.
    Dwell only in the Lord.

    O what holy peace and gladness!
    What a comfort is our Guest,
    No more unbelief and sadness,
    As obeying now we rest.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Like the rain that falls from heaven,
    Like the sunlight from the sky,
    So the Holy Ghost is given,
    Coming gently from on high.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Lo!  a fruitful field is growing,
    Blessed fruits of righteousness;
    And the streams of life are flowing
    In the lonely wilderness.  [Chorus]

    Where we always see his face!
    What a peaceful habitation!

    He justly claims a song from me,

    Loving kindness, loving kindness,
    His loving kindness, etc.

    He saw me ruin'd in the fall,
    Yet lov'd me notwithstanding all;
    He sav'd me from my lost estate,
    His loving kindness, O how great!
    Loving kindness, loving kindness,
    His loving kindness, etc.

    3.
    Tho' num'rous hosts of mighty foes,
    Tho' earth and hell my way oppose,
    He safely leads my soul along,
    His loving kindness, O how strong!
    Loving kindness, loving kindness,
    His loving kindness, etc.

    4.
    When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,
    Has gather'd thick and thunder'd loud,
    He near my soul has always stood,
    His loving kindness, O how good!
    Loving kindness, loving kindness,
    His loving kindness, etc.

    1.
    Jesus, my all to heav'n has gone,
    He whom I fix my hopes upon;
    His track I see, and I'll pursue
    The narrow way till him I view.

    Refrain:
    I'll pursue him, I'll pursue him,
    Yes, I'll pursue my Lord and King.

    2.
    This is the way I long have sought,
    And mourned because I found it not;
    My brief a burden long has been,
    Because I was not saved from sin.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Now will I tell to all around,
    What a dear Saviour I have found;
    I'll point to thy redeeming blood,
    And say, "Behold the way to God."  [Refrain]

    1.
    Who is on the Lord's side?
    Who will serve the King?
    Who will be His helpers
    Other lives to bring?
    Who will leave the world's side?
    Who will face the foe?
    Who is on the Lord's side?
    Who for Him will go?
    By Thy call of mercy, 
    By Thy grace Divine,
    We are on the Lord's side,
    Saviour, we are Thine.

    2.
    Not for weight of glory,
    Not for crown and palm,
    Enter we the army,
    Raise the warrior psalm;
    But for love that claimeth
    Lives for whom He died:
    He whom Jesus nameth
    Must be on His side.
    By Thy love constraining,
    By Thy grace Divine,
    We are on the Lord's side,
    Saviour, we are Thine.

    3.
    Jesus, Thou hast bought us,
    Not with gold or gem,
    But with Thine own life blood,
    For Thy diadem:
    With Thy blessing filling.
    Each who comes to Thee,
    Thou hast made us willing,
    Thou hast made us free.
    By Thy grand redemption,
    By Thy grace Divine,
    We are on the Lord's side,
    Saviour, we are Thine.

    4.
    Fierce may be the conflict,
    Strong may be the foe,
    But the King's own army
    None can overthrow:
    Round His standard ranging,
    Vict'ry is secure;
    For His truth unchanging 
    Makes the triumph sure;
    Joyfully enlisting
    By Thy grace Divine,
    We are on the Lord's side,
    Saviour, we are Thine.

    1.
    Fling out the banner!  let it float
    Skyward and seaward, high and wide;
    Our glory only in the cross;
    Our only hope, the Crucified.

    2.
    Fling out the banner!  angels bend
    In anxious silence o'er the sign,
    And vainly seek to comprehend
    The wonder of the love Divine.

    3.
    Fling out the banner!  sin-sick souls,
    That sink and perish in the strife,
    Shall touch in faith its radiant hem,
    And spring immortal into life.

    4.
    Fling out the banner!  wide and high,
    Seaward and skyward, let it shine:
    Nor skill, nor might, nor merit ours;
    We conquer only in that sign.

    The weary rest from all his pains,
    The captive feel his bondage cease,
    The mourner find the way of peace.

    4.
    Oh, grant us grace, Almighty Lord,
    To read aright Thy holy word,
    Its truth with meekness to receive,
    And by its holy precepts live.

    Buried in sorrow and in sin,
    At hell's dark door we lay;
    But we arise, by grace divine,
    To see a heav'nly day.

    3.

    The spacious earth around,
    While all the armies of the sky
    Unite to swell the sound.

    The heav'ns declare Thy glory, Lord,
    In ev'ry star Thy wisdom shines,
    But viewing Christ within Thy word,
    We read Thy love in clearer lines.

    2.
    The rolling sun, the changing light,
    And nights and days, Thy pow'r confess;
    But the blest volume Thou didst write,
    Reveals Thy justice and Thy grace.

    3.
    Wide be Thy spreading gospel preached
    Till thro' the world Thy truth has run,
    Till Christ has all the nations reached,
    That see the light, or feel the sun.

    4.
    Great Sun of Righteousness, arise;

    Look from the height of heav'n, and send to cheer us
    Thy light and truth, and guide us onward still;

    So, when that morn of endless light is waking,

    My spirit pants for Thee,
    O living Word!

    2.
    Bless Thou the truth, revealed
    This day to me,
    As Thou didst bless the bread
    By Galilee;
    Then shall all bondage cease,
    All fetters fall;
    And I shall find in Thee
    My All-in-All!

    3.
    Spirit and Life are they,
    Words Thou dost speak;
    I hasten to obey,
    But I am weak;
    Thou art my only help,
    Thou art my life;
    Heeding Thy holy word
    I win the strife.
 
 

## 385.  Sabbath Dawn
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WeZTl6CyHjfJXfgLYExOBOvZDVAtLYab/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The dawn of God's dear Sabbath
    Breaks o'er the earth again,
    As some sweet summer morning
    After a night of pain;
    It comes as cooling showers
    To some exhausted land,
    As shade of cluster'd palm trees
    'Mid weary wastes of sand.

    2.
    Lord, we would bring for off'ring,
    Tho' marr'd with earthly soil,
    A week of earnest labor,
    Of steady, faithful toil,
    Fair fruits of self-denial,
    Of strong, deep love to Thee,
    Foster'd by Thine own Spirit,
    In true humility.

    3.
    And we would bring our burden 
    Of sinful tho't and deed,
    In Thy pure presence kneeling,
    From bondage to be freed,
    Our heart's most bitter sorrow
    For all Thy work undone
    So many talents wanted!
    So few bright laurels won!

    4.
    And with that sorrow mingling,
    A steadfast faith, and sure,
    And love so deep and fervent,
    For Thee to make it pure,
    In Thy dear presence finding
    The pardon that we need,
    And then the peace so lasting
    Celestial peace indeed.  Amen.

    1.
    O day of rest and gladness,
    O day of joy and light,
    O balm of care and sadness,
    Most beautiful, most bright;
    On thee, the high and lowly,
    Who bend before the throne,
    Sing, Holy, holy, holy,
    To the Eternal One.

    2.
    Thou art a port protected
    From storms that round us rise,
    A garden intersected
    With streams of paradise;
    Thou art a cooling fountain
    In life's dry, dreary sand;
    From thee, like Pisgah's mountain,
    We view our promised land.

    3.
    A day of sweet reflection
    Thou art, a day of love;
    A day to raise affection
    From earth to things above.
    New graces ever gaining
    From this our day of rest,
    We seek the rest remaining
    In mansions of the blest.

    1.
    Welcome, delightful morning,
    Thou day of sacred rest;
    I hail thy kind return;
    Lord, make these moments blest.
    From the low train of mortal toys
    I soar to reach immortal joys,
    I sour to reach immortal joys.

    2.
    Now may the King descend,
    And fill his throne of grace;
    Thy scepter, Lord, extend,
    While saints address thy face;
    Let sinners feel thy quick'ning word,
    And learn to know and fear the Lord.

    3.
    Descend, celestial Dove,
    With all thy quick'ning pow'rs;
    Disclose a Saviour's love,
    And bless these sacred hours;
    Then shall my soul new life obtain,
    Nor Sabbath-days be passed in vain.

    1.
    Safely thro' another week
    God has brought us on our way;
    Let us now a blessing seek,
    Waiting in his courts today,
    Day of all the week the best,
    Emblem of eternal rest,
    Day of all the week the best,
    Emblem of eternal rest.

    2.
    While we seek supplies of grace
    Thro' the dear Redeemer's name,
    Show thy reconciling face,
    Take away our sin and shame;
    From our worldly cares set free
    May we rest this day in thee,
    From our worldly cares set free
    May we rest this day in thee.

    3.
    Here we come thy name to praise,
    May we feel thy presence near,
    May thy glory meet our eyes
    While we in thy courts appear;
    Here afford us, Lord, a taste
    Of our everlasting feast,
    Here afford us, Lord, a taste
    Of our everlasting feast.

    4.
    May the gospel's joyful sound
    Conquer sinners, comfort saints;
    Make the fruits of grace abound,
    Bring relief to all complaints;
    Thus may all our Sabbaths be
    Till we rise to reign with thee,
    Thus may all our Sabbaths be
    Till we rise to reign with thee.
 
 

## 390.  That Song of Old
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WMJef_wPzWDGt9r_UmeRBLureDJWAl%2Dt/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    It came upon the midnight clear,
    That glorious song of old,
    From angels bending near the earth
    To touch their harps of gold;
    "Peace on the earth, good will to men,
    From heav'n's all-gracious King."
    The world in solemn stillness lay,
    To hear the angels sing.

    2.
    Still thro' the open skies they come,
    With peaceful wing unfurled;
    And still their heav'nly music floats
    O'er all the weary world;
    Above its sad and lowly plains
    They bend on hov'ring wing,
    And ever o'er its Babel sounds
    The blessed angels sing.

    3.
    But with the woes of sin and strife
    The world has suffered long;
    Beneath the angel-strain have rolled
    Two thousand years of wrong;
    And man, at war with man, hears not
    The love-song which they bring;
    O cease, ye mortals, cease your strife,
    And hear the angels sing!
 
 

## 391.  Almighty King

    1.
    Come, thou almighty King,
    Help us thy name to sing,
    Help us to praise.
    Father all glorious,
    O'er all victorious,
    Come, and reign over us,
    Ancient of Days.

    2.
    Come, holy Comforter,
    Thy sacred witness bear
    In this glad hour:
    Thou who almighty art,
    Rule now in ev'ry heart,
    And ne'er from us depart,
    Spirit of pow'r.

    3.
    Thou art the mighty One,
    On earth thy will be done,
    From shore to shore.
    Thy sov'reign majesty 
    May we in glory see,
    And to eternity
    Love and adore.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PferdqWqe58hwVmPE%2D%2DjdFZzyoUQ5z3s/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Sound, sound the truth abroad!
    Bear ye the word of God
    Through the wide world;
    Tell what our Lord has done,
    Tell how the day is won,
    And from his lofty throne
    Satan is hurled.

    2.
    Ye who, forsaking all
    At your loved Master's call,
    Comforts resign;
    Soon will your work be done,
    Soon will the prize be won;
    Brighter than yonder sun
    Then shall ye shine.
 
 

## 393.  Thy Mercies
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7pYKqPrWAanpJwdNEfn139gPmA4qscA/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    When all thy mercies, O my God!
    My rising soul surveys,
    Transported with the view, 
    I'm lost in wonder, love, and praise.

    2.
    Unnumbered comforts to my soul
    Thy tender care bestowed,
    Before my infant heart discerned
    From whom those blessings flowed.

    3.
    Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
    My daily thanks employ;
    Nor is the least a cheerful heart,
    That tastes these gifts with joy.

    4.
    O, how can words with equal warmth
    The gratitude declare
    That glows within my raptured heart?
    But thou canst read it there.

    5.
    Through all eternity, to thee
    A joyful song I'll raise:
    But O, eternity's too short
    To utter all thy praise!
 
 

## 394.  'How Happy Are They!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PNllg03J6G5jDIF%2DxeZ2cPAZZzzEAp6T/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O, how happy are they
    Who their Saviour obey,
    And have laid up their treasure above!
    Tongue can never express
    The sweet comfort and peace
    Of a soul in its earliest love.

    2.
    That sweet comfort is mine,
    Since the favor divine
    I receiv'd thro' the blood of the Lamb;
    Since my heart first believ'd,
    What a joy I've receiv'd,
    What a heaven in Jesus' dear name.

    3.
    'Tis a heaven below
    My Redeemer to know;
    And the angels can do nothing more
    Than to fall at his feet,
    And the story repeat,
    And the Love of sinners adore.

    4.
    Jesus all the day long
    Is my joy and my song;
    O that all to this Refuge might fly!
    He hath loved me, indeed,
    He did suffer and bleed,
    To redeem such a rebel as I.

    5.
    On the wings of his love,
    I am carried above
    All my sin, and temptation, and pain;
    O, that all would believe,
    And by sin never grieve,
    And thus cause him to suffer again.
 
 

## 395.  Wholly Thine
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5fx3tF0gWChGGLa_X1zjyVdIxljlSll/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I would be, dear Saviour, wholly thine;
    Teach me how, teach me how;
    I would do thy will, O Lord, not mine,
    Help me, help me now.
    Wholly thine, wholly thine,
    Wholly thine, this is my vow.
    Wholly thine, wholly thine, wholly thine, O Lord, just now.

    2.
    What is worldly pleasure, wealth or fame,
    Without thee, without thee?
    I will leave them all for thy dear name,
    This my wealth shall be. 
    Wholly thine, wholly thine,
    Wholly thine, this is my vow.
    Wholly thine, wholly thine, wholly thine, O Lord, just now.

    3.
    As I cast earth's transient joys behind,
    Come thou near, come thou near;
    In thy presence all in all I find,
    'Tis my comfort here.
    Wholly thine, wholly thine,
    Wholly thine, this is my vow.
    Wholly thine, wholly thine, wholly thine, O Lord, just now.

    Who has bought us, and sought us, and guided our ways.  [Chorus]

    Rejoice and be glad, the Redeemer has come;
    Go look on his cradle, his cross, and his tomb.

    Chorus:
    Sound His praises, tell the story
    Of Him who was slain;
    Sound his praises, tell with gladness,
    He liveth again.

## 398.  Fount of Every Blessing
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P15GPmzTOE7DlOcu6KJuJBpetMmqzdnD/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Come, thou Fount of ev'ry blessing,
    Tune my heart to sing thy grace;
    Streams of mercy, never ceasing, 
    Call for songs of loudest praise.
    Teach me ever to adore thee,
    May I still thy goodness prove,
    While the hope of endless glory
    Fills my heart with joy and love.

    2.
    Here I raise my Ebenezer,
    Hither by thy help I've come,
    And I hope by thy good pleasure
    Safely to arrive at home.
    Jesus sought me when a stranger,
    Wand'ring from the fold of God;
    He to rescue me from danger
    Interposed his precious blood.

    3.
    O, to grace how great a debtor
    Daily I'm constrained to be!
    Let thy goodness like a fetter
    Bind me closer still to thee.
    Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
    Prone to leave the God I love,
    Here's my heart, O, take and seal it;
    Seal it for thy courts above.

    O, happy day!  that fixed my choice
    On thee, my Saviour and my God;
    Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
    And tell its raptures all abroad.
    Happy day, happy day,
    When Jesus washed my sins away!
    He taught me how to watch and pray,
    And live rejoicing ev'ry day;
    Happy day, happy day,
    When Jesus washed my sins away!

    2.
    'Tis done, the great transaction's done;
    I am my Lord's, and he is mine;
    He drew me, and I followed on,
    Rejoiced to own the call divine.

    3.
    Now rest, my long-divided heart,
    Fixed on this blissful center, rest;
    Nor ever from thy Lord depart,
    With him of ev'ry good possessed.

    1.
    There is no name so sweet on earth,
    No name so sweet in heaven,
    The name before his wondrous birth
    To Christ the Saviour given.

    Refrain:
    We love to sing around our King,
    And hail him blessed Jesus;
    For there's no word ear ever heard
    So dear, so sweet, as Jesus.

    2.
    And when he hung upon the tree,
    They wrote this name above him,
    That all might see the reason we
    For evermore must love him.  [Refrain]

    3.
    So now, upon his Father's throne,
    Almighty to release us
    From sin and pains, he ever reigns,
    The Prince and Saviour, Jesus.  [Refrain]

    1.
    O Love that will not let me go,
    I rest my weary soul in Thee;
    I give Thee back the life I owe,
    That in thine ocean depths its flow
    May richer, fuller be!

    2.
    O Light that followest all my way,
    I yield my flick'ring torch to Thee;
    My heart restores its borrowed ray,
    That in Thy sunshine's glow its day
    May brighter, fairer be!

    3.
    O Joy that seekest me thro' pain,
    I cannot close my heart to Thee;
    I trace the rainbow thro' the rain,
    And feel the promise is not vain,
    That morn's shall tearless be!

    4.
    O cross that liftest up my head,
    I dare not ask to hide from thee;
    I lay in dust life's glory dead,
    And from the ground there blossom red,
    Life that shall endless be!

    And ev'ry one who seeks may pluck
    And weave a garland rare.

    2.
    Thy Word is like a deep, deep  mine;
    And jewels rich and rare 
    Are hidden in its mighty depths
    For ev'ry searcher there.

    May I the fragrant flowers glean,
    Thy graces all divine.

    1.
    The King of love my Shepherd is,
    Whose goodness faileth never;
    I nothing lack if I am His,
    And He is mine forever.

    2.
    Where streams of living water flow
    My ransomed soul He leadeth,
    And where the verdant pastures grow,
    With food celestial feedeth.

    3.
    Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed,
    But yet in love He sought me,
    And on His shoulder gently laid,
    and home, rejoicing, brought me.

    4.
    And so thro' all the length of days
    Thy goodness faileth never
    Good Shepherd!  I would sing Thy praise
    Within Thy house forever.

    Tho' high above all praise,
    Above all blessing high,
    Who would not fear his holy name,
    And laud and magnify?

    3.
    O for the living flame
    From his own altar brought,
    To touch our lips, our souls inspire,
    And wing to heav'n our thought!

    4.
    God is our strength and song,
    And his salvation ours;
    Then be his love in Christ proclaimed

    1.
    By cool Siloam's shady rill
    How fair the lily grows!
    How sweet the breath, beneath the hill,
    Of Sharon's dewy rose!

    2.
    Lo, such the child whose early feet
    The paths of peace have trod,
    Whose secret heart, with influence sweet,
    Is upward drawn to God.

    The Lord be with us as we bend
    His blessing to receive;
    His gift of peace upon us send,
    Before his courts we leave.

    2.
    The Lord be with us as we walk
    Along our homeward road;
    In silent thought or friendly talk
    Our hearts be still with God.

    3.
    The Lord be with us till the night
    Enfold us all to rest;
    Be he of ev'ry heart the light,
    Of ev'ry home the guest.
 
 

## 407.  Choose Some Heralds Here
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyr4det1oQMEFz9riqUK2bkoy1LS1ago/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Our Saviour's voice is soft and sweet,
    When, bending from above,
    He bids us gather round His feet,
    And calls us by His love.

    2.
    He leads to heav'n where angels dwell,
    He saves from endless woe;
    Our lips, our lives, can never tell
    How much to Christ we owe.

    3.
    But while our youthful hearts rejoice,
    That thus He bids us come,
    Jesus, we cry with pleading voice,
    Bring heathen wand'rers home.

    4.
    They never heard the Saviour's name,
    They have not learnt His way,
    They do not know His grace who came
    To take their sins away.

    5.
    Dear Saviour, let the joyful sound,
    In distant lands be heard;
    And oh, wherever sin is found,
    Send forth Thy pard'ning word.

    6.
    And if our lips may breathe the pray'r,
    Tho' raised in trembling fear,
    Oh, let Thy pow'r our hearts prepare,
    And choose some heralds here.

    1.
    O holy Book of truth divine!
    Eternal as thy Maker's name,
    Eternal as thy Maker's name;
    Thro' countless ages of decline
    Thy glowing truths have stood the same,

    2.
    The dust of time is on thy page,
    Yet dims no pure and hallow'd tho't,

    3.
    Thou art the life, the joy, the light,
    The hope of trusting thousands here,
    The hope of trusting thousands here
    Whose faith shall find eternal sight
    Beyond this dreary mortal sphere,
    Beyond this dreary mortal sphere.

    4.
    No other rule by which to live,
    No other faith like thine to save;

    O wondrous lamp of promise sweet!
    Thy light illumes the trusting soul;
    Thy light illumes the trusting soul;
    With glory that shall be complete
    When days and years have ceased to roll,
    When days and years have ceased to roll.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g%2DGUCTUs7a96HQ2vCBVGapnwCB%2D1emG_/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I will follow thee, my Saviour,
    Wheresoe'er my lot may be;
    Where thou goest I will follow;
    Yes, my Lord, I'll follow thee.

    Chorus:
    I will follow thee, my Saviour,
    Thou didst shed thy blood for me;
    And tho' all men should forsake thee,
    By thy grace I'll follow thee.

    2.
    Tho' the road be rough and thorny,
    Trackless as the foaming sea,
    Thou hast trod this way before me,
    And I'll gladly follow thee.
    [Chorus]

    3.
    Tho' I meet with tribulations,
    Surely tempted tho' I be;
    I remember thou wast tempted
    And rejoice to follow thee.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Though thou lead'st me thro' affliction,
    Poor, forsaken, though I be;
    Thou wast destitute, afflicted,
    And I only follow thee.  [Chorus]

    5.
    Though to Jordan's rolling billows,
    Cold and deep, thou leadest me,
    Thou hast crossed the waves before me,
    And I still will follow thee.  [Chorus]
 
 

## 410.  'Can We Forget?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g3adEbfIHh1gv0rbVU39FaDLMyR3Iqp4/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jesus, thy love can we forget,
    And never bring to mind
    The grace that paid our hopeless debt,
    And bade us pardon find?

    2.
    Shall we thy life of grief forget,
    Thy fasting and thy pray'r,
    Thy locks with mountain vapors wet,
    To save us from despair?

    3.
    Gethsemane can we forget
    Thy struggling agony
    When night lay dark on Olivet,
    And none to watch with thee?

    4.
    Our sorrows and our sins were laid
    On Thee, alone on thee;
    Thy precious blood our ransom paid
    Thine all the glory be!
 
 

## 411.  'My Need, And Thy Love'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kxkvsjeLrRHYTPCTbrm41gnYCA2QQMMM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Father, I have naught to plead
    In earth beneath or heav'n above,
    But just my own exceeding need,
    And thy exceeding love.

    2.
    The need will soon be past and gone,
    Exceeding great, but quickly o'er;
    Thy love unbought is all thine own,
    And lasts forevermore.
 
 

## 412.  At Thy Feet
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l2W0ocnq9v0cCMos8SnAp5TLC2I_ixbt/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Lord, who hidest all our shame
    Beneath thy crimsoned hand,
    We feel thy touch, we trust thy name,
    We yield to thy command.

    2.
    We had no courage in the strife,
    No shelter in retreat;
    But thou hast glorified our life,
    We lay it at thy feet.

    3.
    Be thou our King our hearts are thine
    Do with us as thou wilt,
    So nevermore thy love divine
    Be wounded for our guilt.

    4.
    We ask no ease nor joyous hours
    To use for self alone;
    Take thou our thoughts, our ransomed pow'rs,
    And make them all thine own.
 
 

## 413.  Faith Views Him
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1keKgbY_glSIxwLJmG9Q8d7WcPag4Hzvx/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Buried beneath the yielding wave
    The great Redeemer lies;
    Faith views him in the watery grave,
    And thence beholds him rise.

    2.
    Thus do these willing souls today
    Their ardent zeal express,
    And in the Lord's appointed way
    Fulfill all righteousness.

    3.
    With joy we in his footsteps tread,
    And would his cause maintain;
    Like him be numbered with the dead,
    And with him rise and reign.
 
 

## 414.  With Willing Hearts
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kkJPALsiBIynpbD3GvFOxGu5pNKOnzmX/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    With willing hearts we tread
    The path our Saviour trod;
    We love th' example of our Head,
    The glorious Lamb of God.

    2.
    On thee, on thee alone,
    Our hope and faith rely,
    O thou who wilt for sin atone,
    Who didst for sinners died.

    3.
    We trust thy sacrifice,
    To thy dear cross we flee;
    O may we die to sin, and rise
    To life and bliss in thee.
 
 

## 415.  We Live Anew
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kdNTN2gjv9IjrgdWvCjdUDtLWpPDkhxS/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Baptized into our Saviour's death,
    Our souls to sin must die;
    With Christ our Lord we live anew,
    With Christ ascend on high,
    With Christ ascend on high.

    2.
    There by his Father's side he sits,
    Enthroned divinely fair;
    Yet owns himself our Brother still,
    And our forerunner there,
    And our forerunner there.

    3.
    Rise from these earthly trifles, rise
    On wings of faith and love;
    Above, our choicest treasure lies,
    And be our hearts above,
    And be our hearts above.
 
 

## 416.  Blest Be the Tie
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kWBWiktDR2r%2DQVh_g1YlTVCRV5K7FB15/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Blest be the tie that binds
    Our hearts in Christian love!
    The fellowship of kindred minds
    Is like to that above.

    2.
    Before our Father's throne
    We pour our ardent pray'rs;
    Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
    Our comforts and our cares.

    3.
    We share our mutual woes,
    Our mutual burdens bear;
    And often for each other flows
    The sympathizing tear.

    4.
    When we asunder part,
    It gives us inward pain;
    But we shall still be joined in heart
    And hope to meet again.
 
 

## 417.  Forbid Them Not
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1knyK8oN340hq0prqcEAGLC4IQENDO%2DBN/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    "Forbid them not," the Saviour cried,
    "But suffer them to come;"
    Ah, then maternal tears were dried, 
    And unbelief was dumb.

    2.
    Lord, we believe, and we obey;
    We bring them at thy word;
    Be thou our children's strength and stay,
    Their portion and reward.

    3.
    Let not earth's pleasures draw them down;
    Lord, give them strength to rise,
    And thro' thy strong, attractive pow'r,
    At last to gain the prize.
 
 

## 418.  Attempt His Praise
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1klHBjdyA6YbWB0MZyn5Q3j4WqaqliHaM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Come, O my soul, in sacred lays,
    Attempt thy great Creator's praise;
    But O what tongue can speak his fame!
    What mortal verse declare his name!

    2.
     Enthroned amid the radiant spheres,
    He glory like a garment wears;
    To form a robe of light divine,
    Ten thousand suns around him shine.

    3.
    Raised on devotion's lofty wing,
    Do thou, my soul, his glories sing;
    And let his praise employ thy tongue
    Till list'ning worlds shall join the song.
 
 

## 419.  Unseen But Known
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kmN9Pv2p1ItIucn9mFKodXHjYo3TI9Ay/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jesus, these eyes have never seen
    That radiant form of Thine;
    The vail of sense hangs dark between
    Thy blessed face and mine.

    2.
    I see Thee not, I hear Thee not,
    Yet art Thou oft with me;
    And earth has ne'er so dear a spot,
    As where I meet with Thee.

    3.
    Like some bright dream that comes unsought,
    When slumbers o'er me roll,
    Thine image ever fills my tho't,
    And charms my ravished soul.

    4.
    Yet tho' I have not seen, and still
    Must rest in faith alone,
    I love Thee, dearest Lord, and will,
    Unseen, but not known.
 
 

## 420.  Endless Love

    1.
    My God!  how endless is thy love!
    Thy gifts are ev'ry evening new;
    And morning mercies from above,
    Gently distil, like early dew.

    2.
    Thou spread'st the curtains of the night,
    Great Guardian of my sleeping hours!
    Thy sov'reign word restores the light,
    And quickens all my drowsy pow'rs.

    3.
    I yield my pow'rs to thy command;
    To thee I consecrate my days;
    Perpetual blessings, from thy hand,
    Demand perpetual songs of praise.
 
 

## 421.  The Best of Days
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hHu6C4lN5MVOX98toTzROPVX5IOdN6H3/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    This is the day of rest;
    Our failing strength renew;
    On weary brain and troubled breast
    Shed thou thy fresh'ning dew.

    2.
    This is the day of peace;
    Thy peace our spirits fill;
    Bid thou the blasts of discord cease,
    The waves of strife be still.

    3.
    This is the day of pray'r;
    Let earth to heav'n draw near;
    Lift up our hearts to seek there;
    Come down to meet us here.

    4.
    This is the best of days;
    Send forth thy quick'ning breath,
    And wake dead souls to love and praise,
    O Vanquisher of death!
 
 

## 422.  All Things Are Thine
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hE0W2wFpXfhg8Is1YJDcyW9kH2h2_g6E/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    All things are thine; no gift have we,
    Lord of all gifts!  to offer thee;
    And hence, with grateful hearts to-day,
    Thine own, before thy feet we lay.

    2.
    Thy will was in the builders' tho't;
    Thy hand unseen amidst us wrought;
    Thro' mortal motive, scheme, and plan,
    Thy wise, eternal purpose ran.

    3.
    No lack thy perfect fulness knew;
    For human needs and longings grew
    This house of prayer this home of rest
    Here may thy saints be often blest.

    4.
    O Father!  deign these walls to bless,
    Make this th' abode of righteousness,
    And let these doors a gateway be
    To lead us from ourselves to thee.
 
 

## 423.  Thy Presence Here
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hVnFZMgWoM1LvFT4An0ODR0xkNWAhtke/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God of the universe, to thee
    These sacred walls we rear;
    And now, with songs and bended knee,
    Invoke thy presence here.

    2.
    When sad with care, by sin oppressed,
    Here may the burdened soul
    Beneath thy shelt'ring wing find rest;
    Here make the wounded whole.

    3.
    And when the last long Sabbath morn
    Upon the just shall rise,
    May all who own thee here, be borne
    To mansions in the skies.
 
 

## 424.  We Dedicate to Thee
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZCWmyrXaUfxmHYTcLQqCM3W5U6M9wKZ/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Maker of land and rolling sea,
    We dedicate this house to thee;
    And what our willing hands have done,
    We give to God and to the Son.

    2.
    Come, fill this house with heav'nly grace,
    While sinners throng the sacred place,
    And saints, with angel hosts above,
    Unite to sing redeeming love.

    3.
    Here, let the mourning soul find rest
    Upon the loving Saviour's breast;
    And with the sense of sins forgiv'n,
    Each heart aspire to God and heav'n.
 
 

## 425.  Coming Saviour
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1guv_DPFPiiL6e0w_pYXTglJ2u__6Erh7/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Coming Saviour, now in faith
    We remember still thy death;
    Thou wast broken thou hast died;
    For us thou wast crucified.

    2.
    While in faith we drink the wine,
    Of thy blood we see the sign;
    Wash us pure from ev'ry stain,
    Thou that comest soon to reign.

    3.
    Lord, we thus remember thee,
    But we long thy face to see
    Long to reach our heav'nly home;
    Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
 
 

## 426.  God Made Them
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h1iJwdXbuNHYO6dUP3htGETCxXJFfWlh/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Each little flow'r that opens,
    Each little bird that sings;
    God made their glowing colors,
    He made their tiny wings;

    2.
    The purple-headed mountain,
    The river running by,
    The sunset and the morning,
    That brighten up the sky;

    3.
    The cold wind in the winter,
    The pleasant summer sun,
    The ripe fruits in the garden,
    God made them ev'ry one.

    4.
    He gave us eyes to see them,
    And lips that we might tell
    How great is God Almighty,
    Who has made all things well.
 
 

## 427.  Praise Him
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hYJxCqiCSNqpNrlvyGWTs8sZ_hs6c9zf/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Praise, O praise our God and King!
    Hymns of adoration sing;
    For his mercies still endure,
    Ever faithful, ever sure.

    2.
    Praise him that he made the sun,
    Day by day his course to run,
    And the silver moon by night,
    Shining with her gentle light.

    3.
    Praise him for our harvest store;
    He hath fill'd the garner floor;
    And for richer Food than this,
    Pledge of everlasting bliss.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gsMxUbLUf7%2DZb1XoqdyK7cvvxGPpAckK/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The spring-tide hour brings leaf and flow'r,
    With songs of life and love,
    And many a lay to cheer the day
    In many a leafy grove.

    2.
    Dews fall apace, the dews of grace,
    On souls made sad by sin;
    And love divine delights to shine
    Upon the waste within.

    3.
    As year by year the flow'rs appear,
    And birds their praises sing,
    Why not, my heart, bear well thy part,
    In nature's joyous spring?

    4.
    Lord, let thy love, fresh from above,
    Soft as the south wind blow,
    Till my heart bloom in sweet perfume,
    And fragrant spices flow.

    For rest, and food, and loving care,
    And all that makes the day so fair.

    2.
    Help us to do the things we should,
    To be to others kind and good;
    In all we do, at work or play,
    To grow more loving ev'ry day.

    1.
    Another six days' work is done,
    Another Sabbath is begun;
    Return, my soul, enjoy thy rest,
    Improve the day that God has blessed.

    2.
    Come, bless the Lord, whose love assigns
    So sweet a rest to weary minds;
    A blessed antepast is giv'n,
    On this day more than all the sev'n.

    3.
    O that our thoughts and thanks may rise
    As grateful incense to the skies,
    And draw from Christ that sweet repose
    Which none but he who feels it knows.

    4.
    This heav'nly calm within the breast
    Is the best pledge of glorious rest,
    Which for the church of God remains,
    The end of cares, the end of pains.

    1.
    Welcome, welcome, day of rest,
    To the world in kindness giv'n;
    Welcome to this humble breast,
    As the beaming light from heaven.

    2.
    Day of calm and sweet repose,
    Gently now thy moments run;
    Balm to soothe our cares and woes,
    Till our labor here is done.

    3.
    Holy day that most we prize,
    Day of solemn praise and prayer,
    Day to make the simple wise,
    O, how great thy blessings are!
 
 

## 432.  'How Sweet!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hm07GIwaX5tnL3sxARhRQF01ywHUdd1I/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How sweet upon this sacred day,
    The best of all the sev'n,
    To cast our earthly thoughts away,
    And think of God and heav'n.

    2.
    How sweet the words of peace to hear
    From him to whom 'tis giv'n
    To wake the penitential fear,
    And lead the way to heav'n.

    3.
    And if to make our sins depart,
    In vain the will has striv'n,
    He who regards the inmost heart
    Will send his grace from heav'n.

    2.
    Welcome and precious to my soul
    Are these sweet days of love,
    But what a Sabbath shall I keep
    When I shall rest above,

    3.
    O, if my soul, when Christ appears,
    In this sweet frame be found,
    I'll clasp my Saviour in my arms,
    And leave this earthly ground,
    And leave this earthly ground!

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iGHRgXYb5z13YNAL4XA1MX3mFW0ah38i/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    One thot' I have, my ample creed,
    So deep it is and broad;
    And equal to my ev'ry need,
    It is the tho't of God.

    2.
    Each morn unfolds some fresh surprise,
    I feast at life's full board;
    And rising in my inner skies,
    Shines forth the tho't of God.

    3.
    At night my gladness is my pray'r;
    I drop my daily load,
    And ev'ry care is pillowed there
    Upon the tho't of God.

    4.
    I ask not far before to see,
    But take in trust my road;
    Life, death, and immortality
    Are in my tho't of God

    A living spark of holy fire?
    O, kindle now the sacred flame;

    A brighter faith and hope impart,
    And let me now my Saviour see;
    O, soothe and cheer my burdened heart,
    And bid my spirit rest in thee.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iJqhqhFhZL4bQseQqS017c6E_1gcWyU%2D/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I've found the Pearl of greatest price!
    My heart doth sing for joy;
    And sing I must, for Christ is mine!
    He shall my song employ,
    He shall my song employ.

    2.
    Christ is my Prophet, Priest, and King;
    My prophet full of light,
    My great High Priest before the throne,
    My King of heav'nly might,
    My King of heav'nly might.

    3.
    Christ is my peace; he died for me,
    For me he shed his blood;
    And as my wondrous Sacrifice,
    Offered himself to God,
    Offered himself to God.

    4.
    Christ Jesus is my all in all,
    My comfort and my love;
    My life below, and he shall be
    My joy and crown above,
    My joy and crown above.
 
 

## 437.  Prayer
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hqOtTna%2Da5HmkeMgS3W70YyxL%2DwIgycL/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Pray'r is the soul's sincere desire,
    Unuttered or expressed;
    The motion of a hidden fire
    That trembles in the breast.

    2.
    Pray'r is the burden of a sigh,
    The falling of a tear,
    The upward glancing of an eye,
    When none but God is near.

    3.
    Pray'r is the simplest form of speech
    That infant lips can try;
    Pray'r the sublimest strains that reach
    The Majesty on high.

    1.
    Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing,
    Fill out hearts with joy and peace;

    To Thy truth may we be found.

    3.
    While our days on earth are strengthened,
    May we give them, Lord to Thee;
    Cheered by hope, and daily strengthened,
    May we run, nor weary be.
    Till Thy glory, till Thy glory
    Without clouds in heav'n we see.
 
 

## 439.  Join Our Songs
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iFdqyTUva%2DQOXmzJEHNUh5u0X10Na5Y%2D/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Come, let us join our cheerful songs
    With angels round the throne;
    Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,
    But all their joys are one;
    But all their joys are one.

    2.
    Worthy the Lamb who died, they cry,
    To be exalted thus;
    Worthy the Lamb, our hearts reply,
    For he was slain for us;
    For he was slain for us.

    3.
    Jesus is worthy to receive
    Honor and pow'r divine;
    And blessings more than we can give,
    Be, Lord, forever thine;
    Be, Lord, forever thine.

    1.
    Praise to Him by whose kind favor
    Heav'nly truth has reached our ears;
    May its sweet reviving savor
    Fill our hearts and calm our fears.

    2.
    Truth!  how sacred is the treasure!
    Teach us, Lord, its worth to know;
    Vain the hope, and short the pleasure
    Which from other sources flow.

    3.
    What of truth we have been hearing,
    Fix, O Lord, in ev'ry heart;
    In the day of thy appearing
    May we share thy people's part.

    Let thy Spirit, blessed Saviour,
    Come and bid our doubtings cease;
    Come, O come with love and favor,
    Fill us all with joy and peace.

    2.
    Fearful dangers are around us,
    Satan watches to destroy;
    Lord, our foes would fain confound us;
    O for us thy might employ!

    3.
    On thy word our souls are resting;
    Taught by thee, thy name we love;
    Sweetest of all names is Jesus;
    How it doth our spirits move!

    1.
    God of light and matchless splendor,
    Feeble tho' the praise we bring,
    Let thy Spirit touch and tender
    Ev'ry heart as now we sing.

    2.
    Heav'n above cannot contain thee;
    At thy presence earth would flee;
    And tho' ev'ry sin doth pain thee;
    Still thy mercy spareth me!

    3.
    Grateful praise my tongue shall offer,
    'Neath thy smile or 'neath thy rod;
    Take the humble gift I proffer,
    Heart, and mind, and strength, O God!

    Let the whole creation sing;
    Raise your joys and triumphs high;
    Sing, ye heav'ns, let earth reply.

    2.
    Vain the stone, the watch, the seal,
    Christ the mighty, to conceal;
    Death in vain forbids him rise,
    He hath opened paradise.

    3.
    Lead us, Lord, where thou hast led,
    Thou, our High, exalted Head;
    Made like thee, by thee we rise;
    Ours the cross, the grave, the skies.

    1.
    High in the heav'ns, eternal God,
    Thy goodness in full glory shines;
    Thy truth shall break thro' ev'ry cloud
    That vails thy just and wise designs.

    2.
    Forever firm thy justice stands,
    As mountains their foundations keep;
    Wise as the wonders of thy hands,
    Thy judgments are a mighty deep.

    3.
    O God, how excellent thy grace,
    Whence all our hope and comfort spring!
    The sons of Adam, in distress,
    Fly to the shadow of thy wing.

    1.
    He reigns!  the Lord, the Saviour reigns!
    Sing to his name in lofty strains,
    Let all the saints in songs rejoice,
    And in his praise exalt their voice.

    2.
    Deep are his counsels, and unknown.
    But grace and truth support his throne;
    Tho' gloomy clouds his way surround,
    Justice is their eternal ground.

    3.
    In robes of judgment, lo, he comes!
    Shakes the wide earth, and cleaves the tombs;
    Before him burns devouring fire,
    The mountains melt, the seas retire.
 
 

## 446.  In the Cross of Christ
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwuYjIo3GNQBmu4xJ4ADoGufq5y_hiYT/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    In the cross of Christ I glory,
    Towering o'er the wrecks of time,
    All the light of sacred story,
    Gathers round its head sublime.

    2.
    When the woes of life o'ertake me,
    Hopes deceive and fears annoy,
    Never shall the cross forsake me;
    Lo!  it glows with peace and joy.

    3.
    When the sun of bliss is beaming
    Light and love upon my way,
    From the cross the radiance streaming,
    Adds new luster to the sky.

    4.
    Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
    By the cross are sanctified;
    Peace is there, that knows no measure, 
    Joys that through all time abide.
 
 

## 447.  The Rising Day
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dGFx8aa9TRqmiDvGPxzeXh1OZa4xBNIe/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Once more, my soul, the rising day
    Salutes thy waking eye;
    Once more, my voice, thy tribute, pay
    To Him who rules on high.

    2.
    Night unto night His name repeats,
    The day renews the sound,
    Wide as the heav'ns on which He sits
    To turn the seasons round.

    3.
    O God, may all my hours be thine,
    While I enjoy the light;
    Then shall my sun in smiles decline,
    And bring a peaceful night.

    1.
    How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
    In a believer's ear!
    It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
    And drives away his fear.

    2.
    It makes the wounded spirit whole,
    And calms the troubled breast;
    'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
    And to the weary, rest.

    3.
    Dear name!  the rock on which I build!
    My shield and hiding place!
    My never-failing treas'ry, filled
    With boundless stores of grace.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dvI1nyAkiya7r2oObiBIRN8%2DiDnCnujg/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jesus, the very thought of thee,
    With sweetness fills the breast;
    But sweeter far thy face to see,
    And in thy presence rest.

    2.
    No voice can sing, no heart can frame,
    Nor can the mem'ry find
    A sweeter sound than Jesus' name,
    The Saviour of mankind.

    3.
    O hope of ev'ry contrite heart!
    O joy of all the meek!
    To those who fall, how kind thou art!
    How good to those who seek!

    O for a thousand tongues to sing
    My great Redeemer's praise!
    The glories of my God and King,
    The triumphs of his grace,
    The triumphs of his grace.

    2.
    Jesus, the name that calms our fears,
    That bids our sorrows cease,
    'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
    'Tis life, and health, and peace,
    'Tis life, and health, and peace.

    3.
    He breaks the pow'r of cancelled sin,
    He sets the pris'ner free;
    His blood can make the foulest clean
    His blood avails for me,
    His blood avails for me.

    4.
    He speaks, and list'ning to his voice,
    New life the dead receive;
    The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
    The humble poor believe,
    The humble poor believe.
 
 

## 451.  'Before Jehovah''s Throne'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ekwYlc5LUGMiSILHaZWhbNkAZ0WE8ke5/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Before Jehovah's awful throne,
    Ye nations bow with sacred joy;
    Know that the Lord is God alone;
    He can create, and he destroy.

    2.
    We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,
    High as the heav'ns voices raise;
    And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
    Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.

    3.
    Wide as the world is thy command,
    Vast as eternity thy love;
    Firm as a rock thy truth shall stand,
    When rolling years shall cease to move.

    Jesus, thou joy of loving hearts!
    Thou fount of life!  thou light of men!
    From the best bliss that earth imparts,
    We turn unfill'd to thee again.

    2.
    We taste thee, O thou Living Bread,
    And long to feast upon thee still;
    We drink of thee, the Fountainhead,
    As thirst our souls from thee to fill.

    3.
    Our restless spirits yearn for thee,
    Where'er our changeful lot is cast;
    Glad, when thy gracious smile we see,
    Blest, when our faith can hold thee fast.

    4.
    O Jesus, ever with us stay;
    Make all our moments calm and bright;
    Chase the dark night of sin away,
    Shed o'er the world thy holy light!

    1.
    Sing of Jesus, sing forever,
    Of the love that changes never;
    Who or what from Him can sever
    Those He makes His own?

    2.
    With His precious blood He bought us;
    When we knew Him not, He sought us,
    And from all our wand'rings bro't us;
    His the praise alone.

    3.
    Thro' the desert drear He leads us,
    With the bread of heav'n He feeds us,
    And thro' all the journey speeds us
    To His glorious throne.

    1.
    Come, let us sing the song of songs,
    The angels first began the strain,
    The homage which to Christ belongs;
    "Worthy the Lamb, for he was slain!"

    2.
    Slain to redeem us by his blood,
    To cleanse from ev'ry sinful stain,
    And make us kings and priests to God;
    "Worthy the Lamb, for he was slain!"

    3.
    Long as we live, and when we die,
    And while in heav'n with him we reign,
    This song our song of songs shall be;
    "Worthy the Lamb, for he was slain!"
 
 

## 455.  With Reverence

    2.
    Sing, all ye ransomed of the Lord,
    Your great Deliv'rer sing;
    Ye pilgrims now for Zion bound,
    Be joyful in your King,
    Be joyful in your King.

    3.
    O Jesus, Lord of earth and heav'n,
    Our life and joy, to thee
    Be honor, thanks, and blessing giv'n
    Thro' all eternity,
    Thro' all eternity.

    1.
    How pleasant, how divinely fair,
    O Lord of hosts, thy dwellings are!
    With long desire my spirit faints
    To meet th' assemblies of the saints.

    2.
    Blest are the souls that find a place
    Within the temple of thy grace;
    There they behold thy gentle rays,
    And seek thy face and learn thy praise.

    3.
    Blest are the men whose hearts are set
    To find the way to Zion's gate;
    God is their strength; and thro' the road
    They lean upon their helper, God.
 
 

## 457.  From Every Place
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fCh9i088o0cYPa35ZEZ97Z_CW65lubS7/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O thou to whom, in ancient time,
    The psalmist's sacred harp was strung,
    Whom kings adored in songs sublime,
    And prophets praised with glowing tongue,

    2.
    From ev'ry place below the skies,
    The grateful song, the fervent prayer
    The incense of the heart may rise
    To heav'n, and find acceptance there.

    3.
    To thee shall age, with snowy hair,
    And strength, and beauty, bend the knee,
    And childhood lisp with rev'rent air
    Its praises and its prayers to thee.
 
 

## 458.  A Present Help
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f64MaQOL4J0_XJoPxYZ6wEbi_EoWv02u/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    We may not climb the heav'nly steeps,
    To bring the Saviour down;
    In vain we search the lowest deeps,
    For Him no depths can drown.

    2.
    But warm, sweet, tender, even yet
    A present help is He;
    And faith has yet its Olivet,
    And love, its Galilee.

    3.
    The healing of the seamless dress
    Is by our beds of pain;
    We touch Him in life's throng and press,
    And we are whole again.

    4.
    Thro' Him the first fond pray'rs are said,
    Our lips of childhood frame;
    The last low whispers of our dead
    Are burdened with His name.

    5.
    O Lord and Master of us all,
    Whate'er our name or sign,
    We own Thy sway, we bear Thy call,
    We test our lives by Thine!
 
 

## 459.  The Comforter With Us
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ezfaVwaBMfM_taFT2EHxaHTZVX1_G2YM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Our blest Redeemer, ere He breathed
    His tender last farewell,
    A Guide, a Comforter, bequeathed
    With us to dwell.

    2.
    He came sweet influence to impart,
    A gracious, willing guest,
    While He can find one humble heart
    Wherein to rest.

    3.
    And His that gentle voice we hear,
    Soft as the breath of ev'n, 
    That checks the wrong, that calms the fear, 
    And speaks of heav'n.

    4.
    And ev'ry virtue we possess,
    And ev'ry vict'ry won,
    And ev'ry tho't of holiness
    Are His alone.

    5.
    Spirit of purity and grace,
    Our weakness, pitying, see;
    O make our hearts Thy dwelling place,
    Till all like Thee.

    1.
    Sweetly the holy hymn
    Breaks on the morning air;
    Before the world with smoke is dim,
    We meet to offer prayer.

    2.
    While flow'rs are wet with dews,
    Dew of our souls, descend;
    Ere yet the sun the day renews,
    O Lord, Thy Spirit send.

    3.
    Upon the battlefield,
    Before the fight begins,
    We seek, O Lord, Thy shelt'ring shield,
    To guard us from our sins.

    4.
    On the lone mountain side,
    Before the morning's light,
    The Man of sorrows wept and cried,
    And rose refreshed with might.

    5.
    Oh, hear us then, for we
    Are very weak and frail,
    We make the Saviour's name our plea,
    And surely must prevail.

    1.
    This rite our blest Redeemer gave
    To all in him believing;
    He bids us seek this hallowed grave,
    To his example cleaving.

    Chorus:
    I'll follow now my glorious Lord,
    Whate'er the ties I sever;
    He saves my soul, he's left his word
    To guide me now and ever.

    2.
    For me the cross and shame to bear,
    Dear Saviour, thou wast willing;
    Nor would I shrink thy yoke to wear,
    All righteousness fulfilling.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Jesus to thee we yield our all;
    In thy kind arms enfold us;
    Our hearts are fixed, no fears appall,
    Thy gracious power shall hold us.  [Chorus]

    1.
    While in sweet communion feeding
    On this earthly bread and wine,
    Saviour, may we see thee bleeding
    On the cross, to make us thine.
    Tho' unseen, Lord, thou art near us,
    With thy still small voice of love;
    Whisper words of peace to cheer us,
    Ev'ry doubt and fear remove.

    2.
    Bring before us all the story
    Of thy life, and death of woe;
    And, with hopes of endless glory,
    Wean our hearts from all below.
    Draw us nearer and still nearer
    To thy pierc'd and bleeding side,
    Till our view of self grows clearer
    In the light of Him who died.
 
 

## 463.  Submission Sweet
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jlh2B1hiAge5H0KXLJyJsF9WCrwrEVs_/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Thou who on the cross didst make
    Sacrifice complete for me;
    Thou who didst for my poor sake
    Suffer on the cursed tree;
    Thou didst teach submission sweet,
    Washing the disciples' feet.

    2.
    O my soul!  and shalt thou scorn
    Thus to do as He hath done?
    Thou a wretched, dying worm;
    He the blessed, sinless One!
    Gladly would I wish his feet,
    Bowing in submission sweet.

    3.
    Such a joy may not be mine,
    Thus to prove my love for thee;
    Such a privilege divine
    Thou hast never given me;
    But, in blest submission sweet,
    Kneel I at thy servant's feet.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eAVN5Dy%2Dm0Q_PcKO73TGJXOJKQqRaVUL/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Around the world the chorus rings,
    And hands are joined with hands;
    A Brotherhood of Service sings
    In all the happy lands;
    United sounds the watchword still
    That ever has sufficed; 
    "The will, the will, the blessed will!
    The will of Jesus Christ!"

    2.
    In crowded town or lonely plain,
    'Mid many friends or few,
    With man's applause or man's disdain,
    To one allegiance true,
    That sole desire their hearts could fill,
    Tho' all the earth enticed;
    The will, the will, the precious will!
    The will of Jesus Christ!"

    3.
    When proud Ambition gilds her goal,
    When Ease to slumber calls,
    When silken Mammon lures the soul
    To rainbow-tinted halls,
    The Brotherhood of Service still
    Exalts the Pearl unpriced;
    The will, the will, the holy will!
    The will of Jesus Christ!"

    4.
    And when at last the golden years
    Have brought the crowning day,
    When toil and trial, pain and fears,
    Forever pass away,
    Upon the summit of the hill
    Is One that keepeth tryst;
    'Tis He, the Will, the living Will!  
    Our Master, Jesus Christ!"

    Saved to sing His great salvation,
    Saved to live for Him alone.

    Chorus:
    Saved to serve; no reserve;
    Saved to wear His yoke alone;
    Work and praise, all my days,
    Here and round His glorious throne.

    2.
    Saved to show by loving kindness
    That His love is full and free;
    Saved to lead from error's blindness
    With a tender sympathy.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Saved to lift my lowest brothers,
    As the Highest lifted me;
    Crucified with Him, that others
    May have immortality.  [Chorus]

    1.
    A year of precious blessings,
    And glorious vict'ries won,
    Of earnest work progressing,
    Its onward course has run;
    To Thee, O God, our Refuge,
    Whose goodness crowns our days,
    Within Thy earthly temple
    We lift our souls in praise;
    Within Thy earthly temple
    We lift our souls in praise.

    2.
    Thou Master of assemblies,
    In mighty pow'r descend,
    Behold our glad reunion,
    Conduct it to the end;
    Inspire our hearts with courage,
    And deeper love for Thee,
    That all Thy Name may honor,
    Where'er our field may be;
    That all Thy name may honor,
    Where'er our field may be.

    3.
    O Church of God's Anointed,
    March on the lost to win,
    Lead forth thy ranks victorious
    Against the hosts of sin;
    Till at His throne in glory,
    Where angels prostrate fall,
    One Hallelujah chorus
    Shall crown Him Lord of all;
    One Hallelujah chorus 
    Shall crown Him Lord of all.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6jZbQ9woxgJmD1Zm%2D4iegP%2DkUe4ZR88/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I love to tell the story
    Of unseen things above;
    Of Jesus and his glory,
    Of Jesus and his love;
    I love to tell the story,
    Because I know 'tis true,
    It satisfies my longing
    As nothing else can do.

    Chorus:
    I love to tell the story;
    'Twill be my theme in glory
    To tell the old, old story
    Of Jesus and his love.

    2.
    I love to tell the story;
    More wonderful it seems
    Than all the golden fancies
    Of all our golden dreams;
    I love to tell the story,
    It did so much for me,
    And that is just the reason
    I tell it now to thee.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I love to tell the story;
    'Tis pleasant to repeat
    What seems each time I tell it,
    More wonderfully sweet;
    I love to tell the story,
    For some have never heard
    The message of salvation
    From God's own holy word.  [Chorus]

    4.
    I love to tell the story;
    For those who know it best
    Seem hungering and thirsting
    To hear it like the rest;
    And when in scenes of glory
    I sing the new, new song,
    'Twill be the old, old story
    That I have loved so long.  [Chorus]

    1.
    Working, O Christ, with thee,
    Working with thee,
    Unworthy, sinful, weak, 
    Tho' we may be;
    Our all to thee we give,
    For thee alone we live,
    And by thy grace achieve,
    Working with thee.

    2.
    Along the city's waste,
    Working with thee,
    Our eager footsteps haste,
    Like thee to be;
    The poor we gather in,
    The outcasts raise from sin,
    And labor souls to win,
    Working with thee.

    3.
    Saviour, we weary not,
    Working with thee,
    As hard as thine our lot
    Can never be;
    Our joy and comfort this,
    "Thy grace sufficient is;"
    This changes toil to bliss,
    Working with thee.

    4.
    So let us labor on,
    Working with thee,
    Till earth to thee is won,
    From sin set free;
    Till men, from shore to shore,
    Receive thee, and adore,
    And join us evermore,
    Working with thee.

    1.
    Just to trust in the Lord, just to lean on His word,
    Just to feel I am His ev'ry day;
    Just to walk by His side with His Spirit to guide,
    Just to follow where He leads the way.

    Chorus:
    Just to say what He wants me to say,
    And be still when He whispers to me;;
    Just to go where He wants me to go,
    Just to be what He wants me to be.

    2.
    When my way darkest seems, when are blighted my dreams,
    Just to feel that the Lord knoweth best;
    Just to yield to His will, just to trust, and be still,
    Just to lean on His bosom and rest.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Then my heart will be light, then my path will be bright,
    If I've Jesus for my dearest friend;
    Counting all loss but gain, such a friend to obtain,
    True and faithful He'll be to the end.  [Chorus]

    1.
    Rescue the perishing,
    Care for the dying,
    Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
    Weep o'er the erring one,
    Lift up the fallen,
    Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.

    Chorus:
    Rescue the perishing,
    Care for the dying;
    Jesus is merciful,
    Jesus will save.

    2.
    Tho' they are slighting him,
    Still he is waiting,
    Waiting the penitent child to receive.
    Plead with them earnestly,
    Plead with them gently;
    He will forgive if they only believe.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Down in the human heart,
    Crush'd by the tempter,
    Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
    Touched by a loving heart,
    Wakened by kindness,
    Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Rescue the perishing,
    Duty demands it,
    Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
    Back to the narrow way
    Patiently win them;
    Tell the poor wand'rer a Saviour has died.  [Chorus]

    Brightly beams our Father's mercy,
    From His lighthouse evermore,
    But to us He gives the keeping
    Of the lights along the shore.

    Let the lower lights be burning!
    Send a gleam across the wave!
    Some poor fainting, struggling seaman
    You may rescue, you may save.

    Dark the night of sin has settled,
    Loud the angry billows roar;
    Eager eyes are watching, longing,
    For the lights along the shore.  [Chorus]

    Trim your feeble lamp, my brother
    Some poor sailor tempest tost,
    Trying now to make the harbor,
    In the darkness may be lost.  [Chorus]
 
 

## 481.  'Is Your Lamp Burning?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFMOvuyyP8E8nePpzg9GxTA3Y5QxbVtq/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Are you Christ's light bearer?
    Of his joy a sharer?
    Is this world fairer
    For your cheering ray?
    Is your beacon lighted,
    Guiding souls benighted
    To the land of perfect day?

    Chorus:
    O brother!  is your lamp trimm'd and burning?
    Is the world made brighter by its cheering ray?
    Are you wailing, yearning 
    For your Lord's returning?
    Are you watching day by day?

    2.
    Is your heart warm, glowing,
    With his love o'er flowing,
    And his goodness showing
    More and more each day?
    Are you pressing onward
    With his faithful vanguard,
    In the safe and narrow way?  [Chorus]

    3.
    Keep your altars burning,
    Wait your Lord's returning, 
    While your heart's deep yearning
    Draws him ever near;
    With his radiance splendid
    Shall your light be blended
    When his glory shall appear.  [Chorus]

    1.
    An open Bible for the world!
    May this our glorious motto be!
    On ev'ry breeze the truth unfurled
    Shall scatter blessings rich and free.

    Chorus:
    Blest word of God!  send forth thy light
    O'er ev'ry land and ev'ry sea,
    Till all who wander in the night
    Are led to God and heav'n by thee.

    2.
    Where'er it goes its golden light,
    Streaming as from unveiled sun,
    Shall dissipate the clouds of night,
    Undo the work that sin has done.  [Chorus]

    3.
    It shows to men the Father's face,
    All radiant with forgiving love;
    And to the lost of Adam's race,
    Proclaims sweet mercy from above.  [Chorus]

    4.
    It tells of Jesus and his death,
    Of life procured for dying men;
    And to each soul of humble faith,
    Gives sonship with the Lord again.  [Chorus]

    5.
    It offers rest to weary hearts;
    It comforts those who sit in tears;
    To all who faint it strength imparts;
    And gilds with hope th' eternal years.  [Chorus]

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1igwbg5b05LWg7h%2D6ig8Her3Rbu6JL9UX/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God bids his people on the earth,
    Before he comes and calls them hence
    To live unknit to home and hearth,
    Like far bound travelers in tents.

    Chorus:
    We'll live in tents until our feet
    Shall reach the land by sin untrod,
    The gate of pearl, the golden street,
    Whose Builder and whose Maker, God.

    2.
    It is his will that we should pass
    Like strangers, sep'rate and aside
    From all the vain and worldly mass
    That crowd the Babylons of pride.  [Chorus]

    3.
    He'd have us rear no stately towers,
    Sink no foundation walls of stone,
    But camp each night a few short hours,
    And ere the morrow's dawn move on.  [Chorus]

    4.
    O brother, whatsoever chain
    Binds us to fleshly lust and strife,
    Here let us rend it in God's name,
    And live, henceforth, the pilgrim life.  [Chorus]

    Wholly at His commandment let ev'ry soldier be,
    Joyfully serving Jesus, serving with loyalty.

    Chorus:
    Loyal soldiers, let us joyfully march along,
    Forward, forward, with a triumphant song;

    2.
    Loyalty to the Master, letting Him lead the way,
    Glorious is His banner, follow it ev'ry day;
    Into the midst of battle, conquering as we go,
    Victory He has promised over the deadly foe.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Loyalty to the Master, looking to Him alone,
    Turning away from evil, Jesus will keep His own;
    Onward, still onward pressing, seeing the starry prize
    Waiting for all the faithful, meeting beyond the skies.  [Chorus]

    1.
    Take time to be holy,
    Speak oft with thy Lord;
    Abide in Him always,
    And feed on His Word;
    Make friends of God's children,
    Help those who are weak,
    Forgetting in nothing
    His blessing to seek.

    2.
    Take time to be holy,
    The world rushes on;
    Spend much time in secret
    With Jesus alone;
    By looking to Jesus,
    Like Him thou shalt be;
    Thy friends in thy conduct
    His likeness shall see.

    3.
    Take time to be holy,
    Let Him be thy Guide,
    And run not before Him,
    Whatever betide;
    In joy or in sorrow,
    Still follow thy Lord,
    And, looking to Jesus,
    Still trust in His Word.

    4.
    Take time to be holy,
    Be calm in thy soul,
    Each tho't and each motive
    Beneath His control;
    Thus led by His Spirit
    To fountains of love,
    Thou soon shalt be fitted
    For service above.
 
 

## 486.  While the Days Are Going By
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j0huftE95FBpdOhsPjQfJOimbUr54sO%2D/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There are lonely hearts to cherish,
    While the days are going by;
    There are weary souls who perish,
    While the days are going by;
    If a smile we can renew,
    As our journey we pursue,
    O, the good we all may do,
    While the days are going by!

    Refrain:
    Going by, going by,
    Going by, going by;
    O, the good we all may do,
    While the days are going by!

    2.
    There's no time for idle scorning,
    While the days are going by;
    Let your face be like the morning,
    While the days are going by;
    For the world is full of sighs,
    Full of sad and weeping eyes;
    Help your fallen brother rise,
    While the days are going by.  [Refrain]

    3.
    All the loving links that bind us,
    While the days are going by;
    One by one we leave behind us,
    While the days are going by;
    But the seeds of good we sow,
    Both in shade and shine will grow,
    And will keep our hearts aglow,
    While the days are going by.  [Refrain]

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iwyPBZzAZ0011y3usNvteBIZxzvgEHVc/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I cease to sing of sweet tomorrow,
    With selfish thought to be away;
    There is a holier balm for sorrow,
    I find in Christ a sweet to-day.

    Refrain:
    A risen Christ, a living Saviour,
    Not in the tomb where once he lay.
    Whene'er I tell his loving favor,
    Sweet by and by is ev'ry day.

    2.
    I am so happy when I'm telling
    How great his pow'r, how great his love;
    Were there no praise where God is dwelling,
    It would be pain to live above.  [Refrain]

    3.
    If but to gain a home in glory
    The Saviour trod this earth alone,
    There ne'er had been a gospel story,
    He ne'er had left his royal throne.  [Refrain]

    4.
    His love is life, his love is heaven
    Eternal life, eternal bliss;
    Accept it freely, be forgiven,
    And taste the future world in this.  [Refrain]

    1.
    Conquering now and still to conquer,
    Rideth a King in His might,
    Leading the host of all the faithful
    Into the midst of the fight;
    See them with courage advancing,
    Clad in their brilliant array;
    Shouting the name of their Leader,
    Hear them exultingly say.

    Chorus:
    Not to the strong is the battle,
    Not to the swift is the race,
    Yet to the true and the faithful
    Vict'ry is promised through grace.

    2.
    Conquering now and still to conquer,
    Who is this wonderful King?
    Whence all the armies which He leadeth,
    While of His glory they sing?
    He is our Lord and Redeemer,
    Saviour and Monarch divine,
    They are the stars that forever
    Bright in His kingdom will shine.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Conquering now and still to conquer,
    Jesus, Thou Ruler of all,
    Thrones and their scepters all shall perish,
    Crowns and their splendor shall fall,
    Yet shall the armies Thou leadest,
    Faithful and true to the last,
    Find in Thy mansions eternal
    Rest when their warfare is past.  [Chorus]

    1.
    I'm pressing on the upward way,
    New heights I'm gaining ev'ry day;
    Still praying as I onward bound,
    "Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."

    Chorus:
    Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
    By faith on heaven's tableland,
    A higher plane than I have found; 
    Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

    2.
    My heart has no desire to stay
    Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
    Tho' some may dwell where these abound,
    My prayer, my aim is higher ground.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I want to live above the world,
    Tho' Satan's darts at me are hurled;
    For faith has caught the joyful sound, 
    The song of saints on higher ground.  [Chorus]

    4.
    I want to scale the utmost height,
    And catch a gleam of glory bright;
    But still I'll pray till heav'n I've found,
    "Lord, lead me on to higher ground."  [Chorus]

    1.
    Encamped along the hills of light,
    Ye Christian soldiers, rise,
    And press the battle ere the night
    Shall veil the glowing skies;
    Against the foe in vales below,
    Let all our strength be hurled;
    Faith is the victory, we know,
    That overcomes the world.

    Chorus:
    Faith is the victory!
    Faith is the victory;
    Oh, glorious victory,
    That overcomes the world.

    2.
    His banner over us is love,
    Our sword the word of God;
    We tread the road the saints above
    With shouts of triumph trod;
    By faith they, like a whirlwind's breath,
    Swept on o'er ev'ry field;
    The faith by which they conquered Death
    Is still our shining shield.  [Chorus]

    3.
    On ev'ry hand the foe we find
    Drawn up in dread array;
    Let tents of ease be left behind,
    And onward to the fray;
    Salvation's helmet on each head,
    With truth all girt about,
    The earth shall tremble 'neath our tread,
    And echo with our shout.  [Chorus]

    4.
    To him that overcomes the foe,
    White raiment shall be giv'n;
    Before the angels he shall know
    His name confessed in heav'n;
    Then onward from the hills of light,
    Our hearts with love aflame;

## 492.  'Does Jesus Care?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCc1eJrIZunOo__AETOE_jho%2DpbTIalG/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Does Jesus care when my heart is pain'd
    Too deeply for mirth or song;
    As the burdens press,
    And the cares distress,
    And the way grows weary and long?

    Chorus:
    O yes, He cares, I know He cares,
    His heart is touched with my grief;
    When the days are weary,
    The long nights dreary,
    I know my Saviour cares.

    2.
    Does Jesus care when my way is dark
    With a nameless dread and fear?
    As the daylight fades
    Into deep night shades,
    Does He care enough to be near?  [Chorus]

    3.
    Does Jesus care when I've tried and fail'd
    To resist some temptation strong?
    When in my deep grief
    I find no relief,
    Tho' my tears flow all the night long?  [Chorus]

    4.
    Does Jesus care when I've said "good-bye"
    To the dearest on earth to me,
    And my sad heart aches
    'Till it nearly breaks
    Is this aught to Him?  does He see?  [Chorus]

    O blessed rest, when we recline
    On never failing pow'r divine,
    God's mighty arms enfolding us,
    The arms that hold the universe!

    Chorus:
    Casting all your care upon Jesus,
    Casting all your care upon Jesus,
    Casting all your care upon Jesus,
    For He careth, He careth for you.

    Almighty strength!  but stronger yet
    The love that cannot us forget;
    Unfathom'd ocean, calm and broad!
    Amazing mercy of our God!  [Chorus]

    3.
    Beyond the mountain peaks that rise
    Above the clouds and pierce the skies,
    Look up!  the highest wonderful see,
    God's love that fills eternity.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Who trusts His word hath clearest sight,
    Who trusts His pow'r hath greatest might;
    Who trust His love doth never bear
    The heart of doubt, the brow of care.  [Chorus]

    5.
    Man faileth man in trouble's hour,
    As fails at noon the feeble flow'r.
    Who trusts in God, here and afar
    Shines on, tho' faileth sun and star.  [Chorus]

    1.
    The cross that he gave may be heavy,
    But it ne'er outweighs His grace;
    The storm that I fear may surround me,
    But it ne'er excludes His face.

    Chorus:
    The cross is not greater than His grace,
    The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
    I am satisfied to know
    That with Jesus here below,
    I can conquer ev'ry foe.

    2.
    The thorns in my path are not sharper
    Than composed his crown for me;
    The cup that I drink not more bitter
    Than he drank in Gethsemane.  [Chorus]

    3.
    The light of his love shineth brighter,
    As it falls on paths of woe;
    The toil of my work groweth lighter,
    As I stoop to raise the low.  [Chorus]

    4.
    His will I have joy in fulfilling,
    As I'm walking in his sight;
    My all to the blood I am bringing,
    It alone can keep me right.  [Chorus]

    When we walk with the Lord

    And with all who will trust and obey.

    Chorus:
    Trust and obey, 
    for there's no other way
    To be happy in Jesus,
    but to trust and obey.

    2.
    Not a shadow can rise,
    Not a cloud in the skies,
    But his smile quickly drives it away;
    Not a doubt nor a fear,
    Not a sigh nor a tear,
    Can abide while we trust and obey.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Not a burden we bear,
    Not a sorrow we share,
    But our toil he doth richly repay;
    Not a grief nor a loss,
    Not a frown nor a cross,
    But is blest if we trust and obey.  [Chorus]

    4.
    But we never can prove
    The delights of his love,
    Until all on the altar we lay,
    For the favor he shows,
    And the joy he bestows,
    Are for them who will trust and obey.  [Chorus]

    5.
    Then in fellowship sweet
    We will sit at his feet,
    Or we'll walk by his side in the way;
    What he says we will do,
    Where he sends we will go,
    Never fear, only trust and obey.  [Chorus]

    Mine is the asking, His the store,
    Moment by moment, o'er and o'er.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Why should the spirit doubting weep?
    What I've committed, surely He'll keep;
    Mine is the trusting, His the pow'r,
    Moment by moment, hour by hour.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Why for the resting sing or sigh,
    Selfishly seeking mansions on high?

    Than all the universe above.  [Refrain]

    Not a misspent evening let the record bear,
    Not a Christless mission anywhere.

    4.
    Where the toilers hurry neath the lash of Gain,
    Where the idlers gather in the street and lane,
    Where the warriors languish on the field of pain,
    Let me go and whisper His dear name.  [Refrain]

    Of speaking a comforting message for Thee.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Come, all ye that labor, ye weary and worn,
    Come ye who in sorrow or sinfulness mourn;

    Jesus bids us shine with a pure, clear light,
    Like a little candle burning in the night;
    In this world of darkness we must shine,

    Jesus bids us shine thro' the gloom around,
    Many kinds of darkness in this world are found;
    Sin, and want, and sorrow; so we shine,
    You in your corner, I in mine.

    3.
    When we shine for others we shine for Him,
    Well He sees and knows it if our light is dim;
    He looks down from heaven, sees us shine,
    You in your corner, I in mine.

    4.
    Jesus is a bright light of love divine,
    When on Him we're looking, then it is we shine,
    Like the silver moon, with borrowed light,
    Each in his corner, doing right.

    With the shining garments
    And the victor's crown.  [Chorus]

    "Fight the fight of faith" with the hosts of sin!

    Chorus:

    Ever loud and clear
    Sounds the Master's charge for the lands afar.
    None are drafted here!

    1.
    Ask not to be excused,
    There's earnest work to do;
    Stand ready to be used
    Where God may station you.
    His invitation kind
    To thee has oft been giv'n;
    Accept, and thou shalt find
    'Tis sweet to work for Heav'n.

    Chorus:
    Come, O come!
    Ask not to be excused;
    Come, O come!
    Stand ready to be used.
    Ask not to be excused,
    This answer may be giv'n:
    Thou hast my love abused,
    Thou art excused from heav'n.

    2.
    Ask not to be excused,
    The Master calls today;
    Too long hast thou refused,
    Now hasten to obey.
    The harvest fields are white,
    The laborers are few;
    Let this be thy delight,
    The Master's work to do  [Chorus]

    3.
    Ask not to be excused,
    There's danger in delay;
    That wondrous love abused,
    Forever turns away.
    While Mercy gently pleads
    And points the way to heav'n,
    While Jesus intercedes,
    O come and be forgiv'n!  [Chorus]

    My Father's own Son, the Saviour of men,
    Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;
    But now he is pleading for sinners on high,
    And will give me a home when he comes by and by.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I once was an outcast, a stranger on earth,
    A sinner by choice, and an alien by birth!
    But I've been adopted, my name's written down,
    An heir to a mansion, a robe, and a crown.  [Chorus]

    4.
    A tent or a cottage, O why should I care?
    They're building a palace for me over there!
    Tho' exiled from home, yet still I may sing:
    "All glory to God, I'm a child of the King."

    1.
    When peace like a river attendeth my way,
    When sorrows like sea billows roll;
    Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
    "It is well, it is well with my soul."

    Refrain:

    And, Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,
    The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,
    The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend;

    1.
    In heav'nly love abiding,
    No change my heart shall fear;
    And safe is such confiding,
    For nothing changes here.
    The storm may roar without me,
    My heart may low be laid,
    But God is round about me,
    And can I be dismayed?
    But God is round about me,
    And can I be dismayed?

    2.
    Wherever he may guide me,
    No want shall turn me back;

    His sight is never dim,
    He knows the way he taketh,
    And I will walk with him,
    He knows the way he taketh, 
    And I will walk with him.

    3.
    Green pastures are before me,
    Which yet I have not seen;
    Bright skies will soon be o'er me,
    Where darkest clouds have been.
    My hope I cannot measure,
    My path to life is free,
    My Saviour has my treasure,
    And he will walk with me,
    My Saviour has my treasure,
    And he will walk with me.

    1.
    As of old when the hosts of Israel
    Were compell'd in the wilderness to dwell,
    Trusting they in their God to lead the way
    To the light of perfect day.

    Chorus:
    So the sign of the fire by night,
    And the sign of the cloud by day,
    Hov'ring o'er, just before,
    As they journey on their way,
    Shall a guide and a leader be,
    Till the wilderness be past,
    For the Lord our God in His own good time
    Shall lead to the light at last.

    2.
    To and fro as a ship without a sail,
    Not a compass to guide them thro' the vale,
    But the sign of their God was ever near,
    Thus their fainting hearts to cheer.  [Chorus]

    3.
    All the days of their wand'rings they were fed
    To the land of the promise they were led;
    By the hand of the Lord in guidance sure,
    They were bro't to Canaan's shore.  [Chorus]

    1.
    Lift him up, 'tis he that bids you,
    Let the dying look and live;
    To all weary, thirsting sinners,
    Living waters will he give;

    Yet the Prince of heav'n was he;
    And the blind, who grope in darkness,
    Thro' the blood of Christ shall see.

    They shall bear the cross of Jesus,
    And shall find salvation sweet.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Lift him up in all his glory,
    'Tis the Son of God on high;
    Lift him up, his love shall draw them,
    E'en the careless shall draw nigh.
    Let them hear again the story
    Of the cross, the death of shame,
    And from tongue to tongue repeat it:
    Mighty throngs shall bless his name.  [Chorus]

    4.
    O then lift him up in singing,
    Lift the Saviour up in prayer;
    He, the glorious Redeemer,
    All the sins of men did bear.
    Yes, the young shall bow before him,
    And the old their voices raise;
    All the deaf shall hear Hosanna!
    And the dumb shall shout his praise.  [Chorus]

    And the faithful three.

    Chorus:
    Stand for the right
    Wherever you may be,
    Trust in the Lord,

    At the world's decree.

    Governed conscience then,

    So when earthly creeds of error
    Bid you bend the knee,
    Turn and read the simple story
    Of the faithful three.  [Chorus]

    As in days of old,
    All who walk the path of duty,

    1.
    Is there anyone can help us, one who understands our hearts
    When the thorns of life have pierced them till they bleed;
    One who sympathizes with us, who in wondrous love imparts
    Just the very, very blessing that we need?

    Chorus:
    Yes, there's One, only One,
    The blessed, blessed Jesus, He's the One;
    When afflictions press the soul, when waves of trouble roll,
    And you need a friend to help you, He's the One.

    2.
    Is there anyone can help us when the load is hard to bear,
    And we faint and fall beneath it in alarm;
    Who in tenderness will lift us, and the heavy burden share,
    And support us with an everlasting arm?  [Chorus]

    3.
    Is there anyone can help us, who can give a sinner peace
    When His heart is burden'd down with pain and woe;

    And whose blood can wash and makes as white as snow?  [Chorus]

    1.
    Look for the beautiful, look for the true;
    Sunshine and shadow are all around you;
    Looking at evil we grope in the night,
    Looking at Jesus we walk in the light,
    Look for the beautiful, honor the right.

    2.
    Think of the beautiful, think of the true;
    Thoughts like an avalanche sweep over you;
    Keep not the multitude, sort them with care,
    Testing by purity, purging by pray'r;
    Think of the beautiful, think of the fair.

    3.
    Talk of the beautiful, talk of the true;
    Tongues full of poison are whisp'ring to you;
    Answer them not with a talebearing word,
    Only in blessing the voice should be heard;
    Talk of the beautiful, talk of thy Lord.

    4.
    Live for the beautiful, love for the true,
    Lifting the fallen as Christ lifted you;
    Search for the jewels imbedded in sin,
    Bring them to Jesus, his blood washes clean;
    Live for the beautiful, keep love within.

    Chorus:
    Count your mercies, such a boundless store,
    Count your mercies, pressed and running o'er,
    All your mercies, count them o'er and o'er,
    Lost in love and wonder at the boundless store.

    2.
    Think of hidden dangers He has bro't you thro',
    Of the cares and burdens He has borne for you,
    Of His words of comfort in your deepest need,
    Count the times when Jesus proved a Friend indeed.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Does your pathway darken when the clouds draw near?
    Count your many mercies, dry the flowing tear;
    Trust Him in the shadows dim and have no fear;
    "Heav'n will be the sweeter for the dark down here."  [Chorus]

    4.
    As He looks from heaven down on you and me,
    Know you not He chooseth what each day shall be?
    Trust His loving wisdom, tho' the hot tears start,
    Give to Him the incense of a grateful heart.  [Chorus]

    Give us by grace divine,
    Seal us forever thine,
    Our wayward feet incline
    From sin to flee.
    O guide us we implore,
    'Till weary life is o'er,
    And on a brighter shore 
    We dwell with thee.  [Chorus]

    Bring them along to our dear Saviour's home.

    Father's love to us they prove;
    He hath promised; He is faithful,

    Look with fearless eyes above;
    Spanning o'er thy deepest sorrow, 
    Shines the rainbow of His love.  [Chorus]

    And gather together the golden grain;

    Refrain:
    Ev'ry one, blessed tho't!
    Not a single name forgot.
    One left out, His joy would dim;
    Ev'ry one is dear to Him.

    2.
    All my class!  if one be missing
    In the glorious gath'ring day,
    How shall I account to Jesus?
    What shall I with weeping say?  [Refrain]

    3.
    Daily would I walk before them,
    Sinless in God's holy sight,
    Pleading till His Spirit draw them,
    Ev'ry one to life and light.  [Refrain]

    Speak to my soul, dear Jesus,
    Speak now in tend'rest tone;

    Open my heart to hear Thee,
    Quickly to hear Thy voice,
    Fill Thou my soul with praises
    Let me in Thee rejoice.

    Chorus:
    Speak Thou in softest whispers,

    Let me now hear Thy whisper,"

    Hasten Thy coming kingdom,
    Till our dear Lord we see.  [Chorus]

    Speak now as in the old time
    Thou didst reveal Thy will:

    Gladly to do Thy bidding, 
    Honor Thee all my days,  [Chorus]

    Watch, for the time is short;
    Watch while 'tis called today;

    O watch is the darkness, and watch in the day;

    Chase doubting from thy breast;
    Thine is the promis'd prize

    Till from his brow there poured
    Great drops of agony.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Take Jesus for thy trust;
    Watch while the foe is near;

    Make thou no more delay,
    In this accepted time
    Watch, Christian, watch and pray.  [Chorus]

    May angels bright,

    From all our earthly cares and woes,
    And grant that heav'n may greet our sight

    A precious, sure foundation,
    The joy that is my Lord's.  [Chorus]

## 562.  Abiding and Confiding
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fcE0qsVCuaoHoiVYka15QwJTpytrT6Sx/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I have learn'd the wondrous secret
    Of abiding in the Lord;
    I have found the strength and sweetness
    Of confiding in his word;
    I have tasted life's pure fountain,
    I am trusting in his blood,
    I have lost myself in Jesus,
    I am sinking into God.

    Chorus:
    I'm abiding in the Lord,
    And confiding in his word,
    And I'm hiding, safely hiding, 
    In the bosom of his love.

    2.
    I am crucified with Jesus,
    And he lives and dwells in me,
    I have ceased from all my struggling,

    And his Spirit reigns within,
    And his precious blood each moment
    Keeps me cleans'd and free from sin.  [Chorus]

    3.
    All my cares I cast upon him,
    And he bears them all away;
    All my fears and griefs I tell him,
    All my needs from day to day.
    All my strength I draw from Jesus,
    By his breath I live and move;
    E'en his very mind he gives me,
    And his faith, and life, and love.  [Chorus]

    4.
    For my words I take his wisdom,
    For my works his Spirit's pow'r,
    For my ways his gracious Presence 
    Guards and guides me ev'ry hour.
    Of my heart he is the Portion,
    Of my joy the ceaseless Spring;
    Saviour, the Sanctifier, Keeper, 
    Glorious Lord and coming King.  [Chorus]

    Lord, for tomorrow and its needs,
    I do not pray;
    Keep me from ev'ry stain of sin
    Just for today;
    Let me no wrong or idle word
    Unthinking say;
    Set Thou a seal upon my lips,
    Just for to-day.

    2.
    I would both diligently work
    And duly pray;
    I would be kind in word and deed
    Just for to-day;
    O make me strong to do Thy will,
    Swift to obey,
    Willing to sacrifice myself,
    Just for to-day.  

    3.
    And if to-day this life of mine
    Should ebb away,
    O may Thy promises divine,
    Still be my stay.
    So for tomorrow and its needs I do not pray;
    O keep me, guide me, hold me, Lord,
    Just for to-day.  Amen.

    1.
    Will your anchor hold in the storm of life,
    When the clouds unfold their wings of strife?
    When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,
    Will your anchor drift, or firm remain?

    Refrain:
    We have an anchor that keeps the soul
    Steadfast and sure while the billows roll;
    Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
    Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love.

    2.
    If 'tis safely moor'd, 'twill the storm withstand,
    For 'tis well secured by the Saviour's hand;
    And the cables, pass'd from his heart to thine,
    Can defy the blast, thro' strength divine.  [Refrain]

    3.
    It will firmly hold in the straits of Fear,
    When the breakers tell that the reef is near,
    Tho' the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,
    Not an angry wave shall our bark o'erflow.  [Refrain]

    4.
    It will surely hold in the floods of death,
    When the waters cold chill our latest breath,
    On the rising tide it can never fail,
    While our hopes abide within the veil.  [Refrain]

    5.
    When our eyes behold, in the dawning light,
    Shining gates of pearl, our harbor bright,
    We shall anchor fast to the heav'nly shore,
    With the storms all past forevermore.  [Refrain}

    Christian, onward!  Christ is coming,
    Wake the hour of jubilee;
    Nations waiting for the message
    Onward, Christian, victory!
    Hell's proud cohorts almost vanquished,
    Vanquished for eternity.

    2.
    Hear the cry of distant nations,
    Hear the call to you and me:
    Come and lift the fallen sinner,
    Help from Satan's wrath to flee.
    Christian, onward!  Christ is coming,
    Wake the hour of jubilee.

    3.
    Then with strength and courage ever,
    Gird the gospel armor on;
    Faithfully we'll press the battle
    Till the victory is won.
    Christian, onward!  Christ is coming,
    Wake the hour of jubilee.

    4.
    Onward, onward, ever onward,
    Be our watchword in the fray,
    Bear the banner bravely forward,
    Let there be no more delay.
    Christian, onward!  Christ is coming,
    Wake the hour of jubilee.

    1.
    It may not be on the mountain's height,
    Nor over the stormy sea;
    It may not be at the battle's front
    My Lord will have need of me;
    But if by a still, small voice he calls
    To paths that I do not know,
    I'll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine,
    I'll go where you want me to go.

    Refrain:
    I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,
    Over mountain, or plain, or sea;
    I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord,
    I'll be what you want me to be.

    2.
    Perhaps today there are loving words
    Which Jesus would have me speak,
    There may be now in the paths of sin
    Some wand'rer when I should seek;
    O Saviour, if thou wilt be my guide,
    Tho' rugged and dark the way,
    My voice shall echo thy message sweet,
    I'll say what you want me to say.  [Refrain]

    3.
    There's surely somewhere a lowly place
    In earth's harvest fields so wide,
    Where I may labor thro' life's short day
    For Jesus, the crucified;
    So trusting my all to thy tender care,
    And knowing thou lovest me,
    I'll do thy will with a heart sincere,
    I'll be what you want me to be.  [Refrain]

    God is love; we would be like him.

    It helps us "mind," it makes us kind
    To others ev'ry day.

    2.
    This world is full of sorrow,
    Of sickness, death, and sin;
    With loving heart we'll do our part,
    And try some soul to win.  [Refrain]

    3.
    And when this life is over,
    And we are called above,
    Our song shall be, eternally,
    Of Jesus and his love.  [Refrain]

    1.
    Let us gather up the sunbeams,
    Lying all around our path;
    Let us keep the wheat and roses,
    Casting out the thorns and chaff;
    Let us find our sweetest comfort
    In the blessings of today,
    With a patient hand removing
    All the briers from the way.

    Chorus:
    Then scatter seeds of kindness,
    Then scatter seeds of kindness
    Then scatter seeds of kindness,
    For our reaping by and by.

    2.
    Strange we never prize the music
    Till the sweet-voiced bird is flown!
    Strange that we should slight the violets
    Till the lovely flow'rs are gone!
    Strange that summer skies and sunshine
    Never seem one half so fair
    As when winter's snowy pinions
    Shake the white down in the air.  [Chorus]

    3.
    If we knew the baby fingers,
    Pressed against the window pane,
    Would be cold and stiff tomorrow
    Never trouble us again
    Would the bright eyes of our darling
    Catch the frown upon our brow?
    Would the prints of rosy fingers
    Vex us then as they do now?  [Chorus]

    4.
    Ah!  those little ice cold fingers,
    How they point our mem'ries back
    To the hasty words and actions
    Strewn along our backward track!
    How those little hands remind us,
    As in snowy grace they lie,
    Not to scatter thorns but roses
    For our reaping by and by!  [Chorus]

    Chorus:
    Little feet, be careful,
    Where you take me to,
    Anything for Jesus,

    Quite closely all day thro',
    For any act of kindness,
    Such little hands can do.  [Chorus]

    My eyes are set to watch them
    About their work or play,
    To keep them out of mischief,

    Tho' the soil may be sterile and hard,
    The plowshare will make
    The fallow ground break,

    Heav'n's portals will open, and music resound,
    And the mansions of bliss will ring
    With praise for the brave, who labor to save,
    And the angels will joyfully sing.  [Chorus]

    1.
    In the struggle of life there's a conquest to win;
    Would you break from the fetters that bind you to sin?
    Would you vanquish the foe to the cause of the Right?

    He will leave his children never.

    2.
    Would you cast in your lot with the people of God,
    Would you follow the path which the righteous have trod?
    You must ever be fervent and watch unto pray'r,
    And the cross daily learn to bear.
    Live for Christ, yourselves deny,
    Seek your treasures in the sky;
    Marching on till life is over,
    With the faithful gone before.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Would you strive for the prize at the end of the race?

    Unto him that o'ercometh, the promise is giv'n
    Of a home and a crown in heav'n
    Would you dwell forever there?
    On the Saviour cast your care;
    Pressing on till life is over,
    With the faithful gone before.  [Refrain]

    1.
    Give!  said the golden sun:
    Up rose the mist,
    Safe in the silver clouds
    Cradled and kissed.
    Give!  said the thirsty earth:
    Down came the show'r;
    Give!  said the raindrops bright,
    Up sprang the flow'r.

    Chorus:
    Living is giving, giving is living;
    All things would die if only receiving.
    Give!  this is the rule of love by which we live.

    2.
    Give!  said the little stream:
    Up gushed the spring,
    In shady forest nook,
    Where robins sing.
    Give!  said the river wide:
    Brooks hurried down.
    Give!  said the ocean tide:
    Rivers flowed on.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Give!  said the midnight moon:
    Swift came the light
    Borrowed from far-off sun,
    Cheering the night.

    Stars heard the call,
    Orion, Pleiades, 
    Dipper and all.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Give!  cried a sinful world:
    Down came the Lord,
    He who made everything
    Just by his word.

    Hungry for love:
    Yes!  say our pennies bright,
    Lent from above.  [Chorus]

    While we herald the tidings, "Salvation is free!"  [Chorus]

    3.
    To the work!  to the work!  there is labor for all,
    For the kingdom of darkness and error shall fall;

    In the loud swelling chorus, "Salvation is free!"  [Chorus]

    4.
    To the work!  to the work!  pressing on to the end,
    For the harvest will come, and the reapers descend;
    And the home of the ransom'd our dwelling will be,
    And our chorus forever, "Salvation is free!"  [Chorus]

    1.
    We should be like gardens,
    Bright and sweet with flow'rs,
    Bless'd with heaven's sunshine,
    Cheer'd by gentle show'rs;
    Violets are the kind words,
    Roses, deeds of love,
    Fragrant pinks and pansies,
    Tho'ts of God above.

    Chorus:
    Beautiful flow'rs, beautiful flow'rs,
    Bright with morning dew;

    Not a frown of anger,
    Not a shade of care,
    Not one look of sadness
    Do the blossoms wear;
    They are always trusting,
    This is how they grow
    Beautiful and fragrant,
    In a world of woe.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Selfish tho'ts and wishes,
    Unkind words and deeds,
    Are like cruel brambles,
    Thistles, thorns, and weeds;
    Kind tho'ts are the sweetest,
    Loving words the best,
    Yielding hope and comfort,
    Joy, and peace, and rest.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Jesus has a garden,
    Fill'd with children sweet;
    We would be among them,
    Bowing at his feet,
    Drinking in life's waters,
    Growing by his grace,
    Like the flowers, looking
    Up into his face.  [Chorus]

    1.
    If I were a sunbeam,
    This is what I'd do,
    I'd find the dark places,
    Searching the forest through;
    I would kiss the pale flowers,
    Bending low at my feet,
    Till each lonely blossom
    Open'd fair and sweet.

    Chorus:
    Beautiful sunbeam!
    God sent you here;
    I'll be a sunbeam,
    Lonely hearts to cheer.

    2.
    So many dark places
    In this world of sin,
    Why not be a sunbeam,
    Letting the love light in,
    God's beautiful love light,
    Smiles and words of cheer;
    Kindness is the sunshine
    We should scatter here.  [Chorus]

    3.
    If we are like Jesus
    Sun of Righteousness
    Who left the bright mansions,
    Lonely lives to bless,
    'Twill be sweetest pleasure
    Of his love to tell,
    Shining out his gladness
    Where the sad ones dwell.  [Chorus]

    There is beauty all around,
    When there's love at home;
    There is joy in ev'ry sound,

    Time doth softly, sweetly glide,

    All the earth's a garden sweet,
    Making life a bliss complete,
    When there's love at home;  [Chorus]

    3.
    Kindly heaven smiles above,
    When there's love at home;
    All the earth is fill'd with love,

    Sweeter sings the brooklet by,
    Brighter beams azure sky;
    O, there's One who smiles on high
    When there's love at home.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Jesus, make me wholly thine,
    Then there's love at home;
    May thy sacrifice be mine,

    Thro' thy tender mercy blessed,
    When there's love at home.  [Chorus]

    1.
    Angry words!  oh, let them never
    From the tongue unbridled slip;
    May the heart's best impulse ever
    Check them e'er they soil the lip.

    Chorus:
    "Love one another," Thus saith the Saviour,
    Children, obey the Father's blest command:
    "Love one another," Thus saith the Saviour,
    Children, obey his blest command.

    2.
    Love is much too pure and holy,
    Friendship is too sacred far,
    For a moment's reckless folly
    Thus to desolate and mar.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Angry words are lightly spoken;
    Bitt'rest tho'ts are rashly stirred
    Brightest links of life are broken,
    By a single angry word.  [Chorus]
 
 

## 582.  Tell It Again
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dCqgy8ZUj2IlX9Lis3H0j0FQwwyI99h1/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Into the tent where a gypsy boy lay,
    Dying alone at the close of the day,
    News of Salvation we carried; said he,
    "Nobody ever has told it to me!"

    Chorus:
    Tell it again!  tell it again!
    Salvation's story repeat o'er and o'er,
    Till none can say of the children of men,
    "Nobody ever has told me before."

    2.
    "Did he so love me, a poor little boy?
    Send unto me the good tidings of joy?
    Need I not perish?  my hand will he hold?
    Nobody ever the story has told!"  [Chorus]

    3.
    Bending, we caught the last words of his breath,
    Just as he entered the valley of death,
    "God sent his Son!"  "whosoever," said he;
    "Then I am sure that he sent him for me!"  [Chorus]

    4.
    Smiling, he said, as his last sigh he spent,
    "I am so glad that for me he was sent!"
    Whispered, while low sank the sun in the west,
    "Lord, I believe;" "tell it now to the rest!"  [Chorus]

    1.
    Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,
    Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve;
    Waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping,
    We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

    Chorus:
    Bringing in the sheaves, 
    Bringing in the sheaves,
    We shall come rejoicing, 
    Bringing in the sheaves;
    Bringing in the sheaves,
    Bringing in the sheaves,
    We shall come rejoicing,
    Bringing in the sheaves.

    2.
    Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,
    Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze;
    By and by the harvest, and the labor ended,
    We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master,
    Tho' the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;
    When our weeping's over, He will bid us welcome,
    We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.  [Chorus]

    1.
    Master, the tempest is raging!
    The billows are tossing high!
    The sky is o'ershadow'd with blackness;
    No shelter or help is nigh;
    "Carest thou not that we perish?
    How canst thou lie asleep,
    When each moment so madly is threat'ning
    A grave in the angry deep?

    Chorus:
    "The winds and the waves obey my will,
    Peace, be still!
    Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
    Or demons, or men, or whatever it be,
    No water can swallow the ship where lies
    The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies;
    They all sweetly obey my will;
    Peace, be still!
    Peace, be still!
    They all shall sweetly obey my will;
    Peace, peace, be still!

    2.
    Master, with anguish of spirit
    I bow in my grief today;
    The depths of my sad heart are troubled;
    O waken and save, I pray!
    Torrents of sin and of anguish
    Sweep o'er my sinking soul;
    And I perish, I perish!  dear Master;
    O hasten and take control.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Master, the terror is over,
    The elements sweetly rest;
    Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,
    And heaven's within my breast;
    Linger, O blessed Redeemer,
    Leave me alone no more;
    And with joy I shall make the blest harbor,
    And rest on the blissful shore.  [Chorus]

    1.
    Cold water is the cup that cheers;
    Away, away the bowl!
    Old Alcohol is king of tears;
    Away, away the bowl!
    Goodbye to rum and all its harms,
    Farewell the winecup's dread alarms,
    Cold water hath far sweeter charms;
    Away, away the bowl!

    2.
    See how the stagg'ring drunkard reels;
    Away, away the bowl!
    What shame and mis'ry he reveals!
    Away, away the bowl!
    His hungry children cry for bread,
    And from their cold, damp cellar bed,
    They watch for his return with dread;
    Away, away the bowl!

    3.
    No alcohol we'll buy or sell;
    Away, away the bowl!
    We hate it now and ever shall;
    Away, away the bowl!
    United in a temp'rance band,
    We're join'd in heart, we're join'd in hand,
    To drive the demon from our land;
    Away, away the bowl!

    1.
    Look for the way-marks as you journey on,
    Look for the way-marks, passing one by one;
    Down thro' the ages, past the kingdoms four,
    Where are we standing?
    Look the way-marks o'er.

    Chorus:
    Look for the way-marks, the great prophetic way-marks,
    Down thro' the ages, past the kingdoms four.
    Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic waymarks;
    The journey's almost o'er.

    2.
    First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world,
    Then Medo Persia's banners were unfurled;
    And after Greece held universal sway,
    Rome seized the scepter,
    Where are we today?  [Chorus]

    3.
    Down in the feet of iron and of clay,
    Weak and divided, soon to pass away;
    What will the next great, glorious drama be?
    Christ and his coming, 
    And eternity.  [Chorus]

    Life her beck'ning hand;
    Sons of freedom, come ye nigh.

    Chorus:
    Starve the monster from our shore,
    Let his cruel reign be o'er;
    Starve the monster from our shore,
    Let his cruel reign be o'er.

    2.
    Leave the shop and farm,
    Leave your bright hearths warm;
    Work and pray the lost to save;
    Let your leaders be 
    True and noble, free,
    Fearless, temp'rate, good, and grave.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Hail!  our Fatherland,
    Here thy children stand,
    All resolv'd, united, true;
    In the temp'rance cause 
    Ne'er to faint or pause!
    This our purpose is, and vow.  [Chorus]

    Bright the rays celestial shine;
    Precious fruits will thus be given
    Thro' an influence all divine.  [Chorus]

    The world's glorious harvest is fast drawing on,
    The Master is calling his reapers to come,
    The grain bright and golden, in fields far and near,
    Is ripe for the garner when he shall appear.

    Chorus:
    Hasten on, glad day,
    Bear the sheaves away;
    Hasten on, glad day,
    Bear us home.

    2.
    That morn everlasting, that day free from tears
    Is swiftly approaching as on roll the years;
    The wheat, rudely scattered by sin's cruel blast,
    Then hasten to gather e'er autumn be past.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O sweet is the labor that floweth from love!
    A stream never failing, whose Fount is above;

    1.
    Man the life-boat!  Man the life-boat!
    Strong and short above the roar,
    Sounds the order to the watchers
    On the tempest-beaten shore,
    Hark!  again the guns appealing!
    Signals burn for a swift relief;
    There are men and wives and children,
    Facing death, on yonder reef!

    Chorus:  
    Man the life-boat!  Man the life-boat!
    Help, for Christ's sake, them that drown!
    In the peril of great waters,
    Let them not go down!

    2.
    Man the life-boat!  Man the life-boat!
    Fog and night and cruel sea,
    All the odds of death against them,
    And eternal jeopardy.
    Thou, who bid'st us dare the surges,
    Stay us at the struggling oar!
    Nay!  go with us to the rescue!
    Shall they sink in sight of shore?  [Chorus]

    3.
    Man the life-boat!  Man the life-boat!
    Courage, fellow men!  'tis He,
    Guiding us to your deliv'rance,
    Once that trod the Galilee!
    And the boat that carries Jesus,
    Floods of death shall not o'erwhelm;
    Scourging storms but urge us homeward;
    Life and love are at the helm!  [Chorus]

    4.
    Man the life-boat!  Man the life-boat!
    Think how once on breaking deck
    Thou didst stand aghast, till Jesus
    Bro't thee from the lurching wreck.  
    To the oars then!  O Redeemer,
    Let Thy heart throb thro' our hand,
    Till the souls in mortal danger,
    Find thro' Thee the solid land.  [Chorus]

    1.
    Father, hear the prayer we offer!
    Not for ease that prayer shall be,
    But for strength that we may ever
    Live our lives courageously.

    2.
    Not forever by still waters
    Would we idly, quiet stay,
    But would smite the living fountains
    From the rocks along our way.

    3.
    Be our strength in hours of weakness,
    In our wand'rings be our guide;
    Thro' endeavor, hardships, danger,
    Father, be Thou at our side.

    4.
    Ours to sow the seed in sorrow,
    Thine to bid it spring and grow;
    And the golden days of autumn
    Will a precious harvest show.

    1.
    Out from the campfire's red glowing,
    Cheerfully shedding the light,
    Onto the pickets we're going,
    For the long watches of night;
    Let us be careful that slumber
    Press not our eyelids too hard,
    Surely not one of our number
    Must be found sleeping on guard.

    Chorus:
    Sleeping on guard, sleeping on guard;
    No!  Surely not one of our number
    Must be found sleeping on guard.

    2.
    Yonder Rum's camp lights are burning,
    Hark is the revelry there!
    Waiting the conflict's returning,
    Scouts are abroad ev'rywhere;
    We must be watchful and ready,
    See ev'ry entrance is barred,
    Keeping our heads cool and steady;
    All is lost sleeping on guard.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Our aim is vigilance ever,
    We can allow no defeat;
    True hearted soldiers will never
    Join in the coward's retreat;
    Wary and watchful be keeping
    Tho' the task be e'er so hard,
    Knowing what dangers come creeping
    When we are sleeping on guard.  [Chorus]

    1.
    Now to heav'n our pray'r ascending,
    God speed the right!
    In a noble cause contending,
    God speed the right!
    Be our zeal in heav'n recorded,
    With success on earth rewarded,
    God speed the right,
    God speed the right!

    Be that prayer again repeated,

    Like the good and great in story,
    If we fail, we fail with glory;
    God speed the right!

    3.
    Patient, firm, and persevering,
    God speed the right!
    No event nor danger fearing,
    God speed the right!
    Pain, nor toil, nor trial heeding,
    And in His own time succeeding;
    God speed the right!

    4.
    Still our onward course pursuing,
    God speed the right!
    Every foe at length subduing,
    God speed the right!
    Truth, our cause, whate'er delay it,
    There's no power on earth can stay it,
    God speed the right!

    1.
    My God, is any hour so sweet,
    From blush of morn to evening star,
    As that which calls me to Thy feet,
    The hour of pray'r?

    Here for my ev'ry want I find;
    What strength for warfare, balm for grief,
    What peace of mind.

    3.
    Hush'd is each doubt, gone evry fear;
    My spirit seems in heav'n to stay;
    And e'en the penitential tear
    Is wiped away.

    Lord, till I reach that blissful shore,
    No privilege so dear shall be
    As thus my inmost soul to pour
    In pray'r to Thee.

    Those precious souls to gain.  [Chorus]

    Pay any price to win;
    With Heaven's legions watching you,
    To falter will be sin.  [Chorus]

    At home; in lands afar;
    Go quickly!  Find the jewels rare,
    Each soul a glowing star.  [Chorus]

    He tells how to try,
    And so we talk together,
    My Lord and I.

    4.
    He knows that I am longing
    Some weary soul to win,
    And so He bids me go and speak
    The loving word for Him;
    He bids me tell His wondrous love,
    And why He came to die,
    And so we work together,
    My Lord and I.

    Source of true wisdom, yet ruling by love;
    Our great Example and Shepherd we follow,
    Till Thy fold we shall enter above.

## 604.  More Diligence
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18L9mDfqRfdY510zezdiJiYNslOJuHYWz/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    More diligence give me;
    Swift flieth the day,
    Each moment some lost one
    Is passing away;
    How can I be idle,
    Christ knowing so well?
    More diligence give me,
    Love's story to tell.

    2.
    More tenderness give me
    For wandering sheep,
    Like Jesus the Sheperd,
    To search and to weep
    In byways and hedges,
    O'er desert and sea;
    More tenderness give me
    For sinners like me. 

    3.
    More gratitude give me,
    More love for my Lord,
    More gifts for the Giver
    Who spreadeth my board;
    More mem'ries of mercies,
    More praises in pray'r,
    More gladness in labor,
    More trust with my care.

    4.
    More purity give me,
    More hatred of sin,
    More hung'ring and thirsting
    For goodness within;
    More watching and praying,
    From self to be free;
    More fruits of the Spirit,
    More, Jesus, of thee.
 
 

## 605.  Chide Mildly the Erring
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18IAuh9ERShyut4fAqdNzxOA9QiAUBbYg/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Chide mildly the erring,
    Kind language endears,
    Grief follows the sinful,
    Add not to their tears;
    Avoid with reproaches
    Fresh pain to bestow;
    The heart that is stricken
    Needs never a blow.

    2.
    Chide mildly the erring,
    Jeer not at their fall;
    If strength be but human,
    How feeble were all!
    What marvel that footsteps
    Should wander away,
    When tempests so darken
    Life's wearisome way?

    3.
    Chide mildly the erring,
    Entreat them with care;
    Their natures are mortal,
    They need not despair.
    We all have some frailty,
    We all are unwise;
    The grace which redeems us
    Must come from the skies.
 
 

## 606.  'Not Now, My Child'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18DaiOOVZN%2DtjnemkbCAsf1wY63EvWeiE/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Not now, my child, a little more rough tossing,
    A little longer on the billow's foam;
    A few more journ'yings in the desert darkness,
    And then, the sunshine of thy Father's home!

    2.
    Not now; for I have wand'rers in the distance,
    And thou must call them in with patient love;
    Not now; for I have sheep upon the mountains,
    And thou must follow them where'er they rove.

    3.
    Not now; for I have loved ones sad and weary;
    Wilt thou not cheer them with a kindly smile?
    Sick ones, who need thee in their lonely sorrow;
    Wilt thou not tend them yet a little while?

    4.
    Not now; for wounded hearts are sorely bleeding,
    And thou must teach those widowed hearts to sing;
    Not now; for orphans' tears are ever falling,
    They must be gathered 'neath some shelt'ring wing.

    5.
    Go, with the name of Jesus to the dying,
    And speak that Name in all its living pow'r;
    Why should thy fainting heart grow chill and weary?
    Canst thou not watch with me one little hour?

    6.
    One little hour!  and then the glorious crowning,
    The golden harp strings, and the victor's palm;
    One little hour!  and then the hallelujah!
    Eternity's long, deep, thanksgiving psalm!

    1.
    Let us work for the school with our hearts and our hands;
    For its praises are sung by the good in all lands
    Let it never, no never, decline;
    That are blest with the gospel divine.
    Rally then, rally then, stand by the school;
    Why should it languish and die?
    Rally then, rally then, stand by the school;
    Why should it languish and die?

    2.
    'Tis perfum'd by the pray'rs, 'tis bedewed by the tears
    They rejoiced at its hopes, and they mourned at its fears,
    Of the holy, the active, the true;
    When its friends were but feeble and few.
    Rally then, rally then, stand by the school;
    Why should it languish and die?
    Rally then, rally then, stand by the school;
    Why should it languish and die?

    3.
    Now the sunshine of favor illumines its path
    'Tis a source of her weal, 'tis a source of her worth,
    And the church spreads above it her wing;
    And a gem in the crown of her King.
    Rally then, rally then, stand by the school;
    Why should it languish and die?
    Rally then, rally then, stand by the school;
    Why should it languish and die?

    Here first my wilful, wand'ring heart,
    The way of life was shown,
    Here first I sought the better part,
    And gained a Sabbath Home.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Here Jesus stood with loving voice,
    Entreating me to come,
    And make of Him my only choice,
    In this dear Sabbath Home.  [Chorus]

    1.
    I am passing down the valley that they say is so lone
    'Tis to me the vale of Beulah, 'tis a beautiful way,
    But I find that all the pathway is with flowers o'ergrown.
    For the Saviour walks besid me, my companion all day.

    Chorus:
    Vale of Beulah, Vale of Beulah,
    Thou art precious to me;
    For the lovely land of promise
    In the distance I see.

    2.
    Not a shadow, not a shadow ever darkens the way,
    And the music, sweetly chanted by the heavenly throng,

    Floats in cadence down the valley, and it cheers me along.  [Chorus]

    So I journey with rejoicing toward the city of light,

    2.
    All the way my Saviour leads me;
    Cheers each winding path I tread;
    Gives me grace for every trial,
    Feeds me with the living bread;
    Tho' my weary steps may falter,
    And my soul athirst may be,
    Gushing from the Rock before me,
    Lo!  a spring of joy I see;
    Gushing from the rock before me,
    Lo!  a spring of joy I see.

    3.

    Oh, the fullness of His love!
    Perfect rest to me is promised

    This my song thro' endless ages
    Jesus led me all the way;
    This my song thro' endless ages
    Jesus led me all the way.

    O, then to the Rock let me fly, 
    To the Rock that is higher than I;
    O, then to the Rock let me fly, 
    To the Rock that is higher than I.

    2.
    O sometimes how long seems the day,
    And sometimes how heavy my feet;
    But toiling in life's dusty way,
    The Rock's blessed shadow, how sweet!  [Chorus]

    3.
    O near to the Rock let me keep,
    Or blessings or sorrows prevail;
    Or climbing the mountain way steep,
    Or walking the shadowy vale.  [Chorus]
 
 

## 614.  Something for Jesus\_1
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13_nmtr4DMWD2Io3XAg0W02VAoOWyxpnO/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Saviour!  Thy dying love 
    Thou gavest me,
    Nor should I aught withhold, 
    Dear Lord, from Thee;
    In love my soul would bow,
    My heart fulfill its vow,
    Some off'ring bring Thee now,
    Something for Thee.

    2.
    At the blest mercy-seat, 
    Pleading for me,
    My feeble faith looks up, 
    Jesus to Thee;
    Help me the cross to bear,
    Thy wondrous love declare,
    Some song to raise, or pray'r,
    Something for Thee.

    3.
    Give me a faithful heart,
    Likeness to Thee,
    That each departing day 
    henceforth may see;
    Some work of love begun,
    Some deed of kindness done,
    Some wand'rer sought and won,
    Something for Thee.

    4.
    All that I am and have, 
    Thy gifts so free,
    In joy, in grief, thro' life, 
    Dear Lord, for Thee!
    And when Thy face I see, 
    My ransom'd soul shall be,
    Thro' all eternity,
    Something for Thee.
 
 

## 615.  Jesus Only
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13HGT8DCDOm3JRWncQhxP8yZtL6vRR9A7/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    What tho' clouds are hov'ring o'er me,
    And I seem to walk alone,
    Longing 'mid my cares and crosses,
    For the joys that now are flown,
    If I've Jesus, "Jesus only,"
    Then my sky will have a gem;
    He's a Sun of brightest splendor,
    And the Star of Bethlehem.

    2.
    What tho' all my earthly journey
    Bringeth naught but weary hours,
    And, in grasping for life's roses,
    Thorns I find instead of flow'rs,
    If I've Jesus, "Jesus only,"
    I possess a cluster rare;
    He's the "Lily of the Valley,"
    And the "Rose of Sharon" fair.

    3.
    What tho' all my heart is yearning
    For the lov'd of long ago,
    Bitter lessons sadly learning
    From the shadowy page of woe,
    If I've Jesus, "Jesus only," 
    He'll be with me to the end;
    And, unseen by mortal vision,
    Angel bands will o'er me bend.

    4.
    When I soar to realms of glory,
    And an entrance I await,
    If I've followed "Jesus only!"
    Wide will ope the pearly gate;
    When I join the heav'nly chorus,
    And the angel hosts I see,
    Precious Jesus, "Jesus only,"
    Will my theme of rapture be.
 
 

## 616.  Call Them In
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13KV3vl4IBf53p86H%2DxpVDX%2DLkheRE3Uu/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    "Call them in", the wretched,
    Sin-stained wand'rers from the field;
    Peace and pardon freely offer;
    Can you weigh their worth with gold;
    "Call them in," the weak the weary,
    Laden with the doom of sin;
    Bid them come and rest in Jesus;
    He is waiting, "Call them in."

    2.
    "Call them in", the Jew, the Gentile;
    Bid the stranger to the feast:
    "Call them in", the rich, the noble,
    From the highest to the least:
    Forth the Father runs to meet them,
    He hath all their sorrows seen;
    Robe, and ring, and royal sandals,
    Wait the lost ones, "Call them in."

    3.
    "Call them in", the mere professors,
    Slumbering, sleeping, on death's brink;
    Naught of life are they possessors,
    Yet of safety vainly think:
    Bring them in, the careless scoffers,
    Pleasure seekers of the earth:
    Tell of God's most gracious offers,
    And of Jesus' priceless worth.

    4.
    "Call them in", the broken-hearted,
    Cowering 'neath the brand of shame;
    Speak love's message low and tender,
    'Twas for sinners Jesus came:
    See, the shadows lengthen round us,
    Soon the day dawn will begin;
    Can you leave them lost and lonely?
    Christ is coming, "Call them in."
 
 

## 617.  A Cry from Macedonia
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/143JxJ_EK6ieJ3nXy%2D_cgAtXv1m42X2Hw/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There's a cry from Macedonia  Come and help us,
    The light of the precious gospel bring,
    Let us hear the joyful tidings of salvation,
    We thirst for the living spring.
    O, ye heralds of the cross, be up and doing,
    Remember the Saviour's great command,
    Go ye forth and preach the word to ev'ry creature,
    Proclaim it in ev'ry land. 

    Chorus:
    They shall gather from the East,
    They shall gather from the West,
    With the patriarchs of old.
    And the ransom'd shall return
    To the kingdom of the blest,
    With their harps and crowns of gold.
    There's a cry from Macedonia  Come and help us,
    The light of the precious gospel bring,
    Let us hear the joyful tidings of salvation,
    We thirst for the living spring.
    O, ye heralds of the cross, be up and doing,
    Remember the Saviour's great command,
    Go ye forth and preach the word to ev'ry creature,
    Proclaim it in ev'ry land.

    2.
    O how beautiful their feet upon the mountains,
    The tidings of peace from God who bring,
    To the nations of the earth who sit in darkness,
    And tell them of Zion's King.
    Then, ye heralds of the cross, be up and doing,
    Go work in your blessed Master's field,
    Sound the trumpet, sound the trumpet of salvation,
    The Lord is your strength and shield.

    Chorus:
    Let the distant isles be glad,
    Let them hail the Saviour's birth,
    And the news of pardon free,
    Till the knowledge of the truth
    Shall extend to all the earth, 
    As the waters o'er the sea.
    There's a cry from Macedonia  Come and help us,
    The light of the precious gospel bring,
    Let us hear the joyful tidings of salvation,
    We thirst for the living spring.
    O, ye heralds of the cross, be up and doing,
    Remember the Saviour's great command,
    Go ye forth and preach the word to ev'ry creature,
    Proclaim it in ev'ry land.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13VrJ1WAlWUIW8lLAB8amT1Ny%2D3C25eOt/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,
    Bless Thy little lamb to-night;
    Thro' the darkness be Thou near me,
    Keep me safe till morning light.

    2.
    All this day Thy hand has led me,
    And I thank Thee for Thy care,
    Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me,
    Listen to my evening pray'r.

    3.
    May my sins be all forgiven,
    Bless the friends I love so well,
    Take us all at last to heaven,
    Happy there with Thee to dwell.
 
 

## 619.  One Foundation
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/148nxe19qkREXe_ljcFeEY_vN7XA28CjQ/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The Church has one foundation,
    'Tis Jesus Christ her Lord;
    She is His new creation,
    By water and the word;
    From heav'n He came and sought her
    To be His holy bride,
    With His own blood He bo't her,
    And for her life He died.

    2.
    Elect from ev'ry nation,
    Yet one o'er all the earth,
    Her charter of salvation,
    One Lord, one faith, one birth;
    One holy name she blesses,
    Partakes one holy food,
    And to one hope she presses,
    With ev'ry grace endued.

    3.
    Tho' with a scornful wonder,
    Men see her sore opprest,
    Tho' foes would rend asunder
    The rock where she doth rest;
    Yet saints their faith are keeping,
    Their cry goes up, "How long?"
    And soon the night of weeping
    Shall be the morn of song.

    4.
    'Mid toil and tribulation,
    And tumult of her war,
    She waits the consummation
    Of peace for ever more;
    Till with the vision glorious
    Her longing eyes are blest,
    And the great Church victorious
    Shall be the Church at rest.
 
 

## 620.  'I Need Thee, Precious Jesus'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13rmOkiKpeUoOPrmPrTz4BRCZyjsdnsXD/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I need Thee, precious Jesus,
    For I am very poor;
    A stranger and a pilgrim,
    I have no earthly store.
    I need the love of Jesus
    To cheer me on my way,
    To guide my doubting footsteps,
    To be my strength and stay.

    2.
    I need the heart of Jesus
    To feel each anxious care,
    To tell my ev'ry trial,
    And all my sorrows share.
    I need the Holy Spirit
    To teach me what I am,
    To show me more of Jesus,
    To point me to the Lamb.

    3.
    I need Thee, precious Jesus,
    I hope to see Thee soon,
    Encircled with the rainbow,
    And seated on Thy throne.
    There, with Thy blood-bought children,
    My joy shall ever be
    To sing Thy ceaseless praises,
    To gaze, my Lord, on Thee!  Amen.

    1.
    The whole wide world is pleading:
    Ye men of God arise!
    His providence is leading
    To many'a glad surprise,
    Lo!  ev'ry sky is bright'ning,
    Rich promise clothes the soil;
    Wide fields for harvest whit'ning,
    Invite the reaper's; toil.

    2.
    Go, where the waves are breaking
    On coldest Northern shore,
    The precious Gospel taking,
    More rich than golden ore.
    On highest Eastern mountain,
    In lowest Western vale;
    Beside the Southern fountains,
    Rehearse the wondrous tale.

    3.
    The love of Christ unfolding,
    Speed on from east to west,
    Till all, by faith behold,
    In Christ are fully blest.
    Great Author of salvation,
    Haste, haste the glorious day
    Great Author of salvation,
    Haste, haste the glorious day
    Foretold by revelation,
    Thy universal sway,
 
 

## 622.  'Why Stand With Rusty Blade?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/150DdT48D8A3ByYtYp2aSo2%2DF_bHoJH_Y/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Ho!  reaper of life's harvest,
    Why stand with rusty blade,
    Until the night draws round thee,
    And day begins to fade?
    Why stand ye idle, waiting
    For reapers more to come?
    The golden morn is passing,
    Why stand ye idle, dumb?

    2.
    Come down from hill and mountain,
    In morning's ruddy glow,
    Nor wait until the dial
    Points to the noon below;
    And come with the strong sinew,
    Nor faint in heat or cold;
    And pause not till the evening
    Draws round its wealth of gold.

    3.
    Mount up the hights of wisdom,
    And crush each error low;
    Keep back no words of knowledge
    That human hearts should know;
    Be faithful to thy mission,
    In service of thy Lord,
    And soon a golden chaplet
    Will be thy rich reward.
 
 

## 623.  Our Endeavor
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14dAkDW8xXssP%2DTSeQiyCHCbQDrj6EtHo/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    For Christ is our endeavor,
    Our hearts to Him belong;
    His presence cheers us ever,
    His love inspires our song;
    We come in youth's bright morning,
    Obedient to His word,
    And seek for our adorning,
    The beauty of the Lord.

    2.
    In fulness of His blessing,
    Good work for Him we'll do;
    His name with joy confessing,
    His standard bearers true;
    And He will never fail us,
    Whatever may betide;
    Tho' danger should assail us,
    In Him we safe abide.

    3.
    So with youth's ardor showing,
    We form a Christian band;
    The mind of Jesus knowing,
    We for His honor stand;
    For He is our Endeavor,
    And to Him we belong,
    Whose grace shall fail us never,
    Whose love inspires our song.
 
 

## 624.  They Call Us
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14gWM8zd_Ph8VTnnLUaTzu1cNzV8sA7ia/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    From Greenland's icy mountains,
    From India's coral strand,
    Where Afric's sunny fountains
    Roll down their golden sand,
    From many an ancient river,
    From many a palmy plain,
    They call us to deliver
    Their land from error's chain.

    2.
    What tho' the spicy breezes
    Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle;
    Tho' ev'ry prospect pleases,
    And only man is vile;
    In vain with lavish kindness
    The gifts of God are strown;
    The heathen in his blindness,
    Bows down to wood and stone.  

    3.
    Shall we whose souls are lighted,
    With wisdom from on high,
    Shall we to men benighted,
    The lamp of life deny?
    Salvation, O salvation!
    The joyful sound proclaim
    Till earth's remotest nation
    Has heard Messiah's name.

    4.
    Waft, waft, ye winds, His story,
    Ye waters, onward roll,
    Till, like a sea of glory,
    It spreads from pole to pole;
    Till o'er our ransomed nature
    The Lamb for sinners slain
    Redeemer, King, Creator--
    In bliss returns to reign.
 
 

## 625.  I Could Not Do Without
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14w5bKNru_hR6DdqIJxZx6S%2DzskWT5z07/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I could not do without Thee,
    O Saviour of the lost,
    Whose wondrous love redeemed me,
    At such tremendous cost;
    Thy righteousness, Thy pardon,
    Thy precious blood must be
    My only hope and comfort, 
    My glory and my plea.

    2.
    I could not do without Thee,
    I cannot stand alone,
    I have no strength or goodness,
    No wisdom of my own;
    But Thou, beloved Saviour,
    Art all in all to me,
    And weakness will be power
    If leaning hard on Thee.

    3.
    I could not do without Thee,
    For, oh, the way is long,
    And I am often weary,
    And sigh replaces song:
    How could I do without Thee?
    I do not know the way;
    Thou knowest, and Thou leadest,
    And wilt not let me stray.

    4.
    I could not do without Thee,
    For years are fleeting fast,
    And soon in solemn silence,
    The river must be passed;
    But Thou wilt never leave me,
    And tho' the waves roll high,
    I know Thou wilt be near me,
    And whisper "It is I."  Amen.
 
 

## 626.  My Safety
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14LY5_dFyKDeCV6BkYjOTvArSq5mmz_mT/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Lamb of God!  still keep me
    Near to Thy wounded side;
    'Tis only there in safety
    And peace I can abide!
    What foes and snares surround me,
    What doubts and fears within!
    The grace that sought and found me,
    Alone can keep me clean.

    2.
    'Tis only in Thee hiding
    I know my life secure
    Only in Thee abiding,
    The conflict can endure:
    Thine arm the victory gaineth
    O'er ev'ry hateful foe;
    Thy love my heart sustaineth
    In all its care and woe.

    3.
    Soon shall my eyes behold Thee,
    With rapture, face to face;
    One half hath not been told me
    Of all Thy pow'r and grace.
    Thy beauty, Lord, and glory,
    The wonders of Thy love,
    Shall be the endless story
    Of all the saints above.
 
 

## 627.  Soldiers of the Cross
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14s%2Dym14ZfpVRzTxQJXdblg5Pkmi2hn4S/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Soldiers of the cross, arise!
    Lo!  your Leader from the skies
    Waves before you glory's prize,
    Prize of victory.
    Seize your armor, gird it on:
    Soon the battle will be won;
    See!  the strife is almost done;
    Struggle manfully.

    2.
    Now the fight of faith begin,
    Be no more the slaves of sin,
    Strive the victor's palm to win,
    Trusting in the Lord:
    Gird ye on the armor bright,
    Warriors of the King of Light,
    Never yield, nor lose by flight
    Your divine reward.

    3.
    Jesus conquered when he fell,
    Met and vanquished sin and hell;
    Now he bids his foll'wers tell
    Triumphs of his cross.
    Tho' the evil hosts appear,
    Who can doubt, or who can fear?
    God our strength and shield, is near;
    Can we suffer loss?

    1.
    Stand up!  stand up for Jesus!
    Ye soldiers of the cross;
    Lift high his royal banner,
    It must not suffer loss:
    From vict'ry unto vict'ry.
    His army shall he lead.
    Till ev'ry foe is vanquished,
    And Christ is Lord indeed.

    2.
    Stand up!  stand up for Jesus!
    The trumpet call obey;
    Forth to the mighty conflict,
    In this his glorious day:
    Ye that are men now serve him,
    Against unnumbered foes;
    Let courage rise with danger,
    And strength to strength oppose.

    3.
    Stand up!  stand up for Jesus!
    Stand in his strength alone;
    The arm of flesh will fail you;
    Ye dare not trust your own:
    Put on the gospel armor,
    And, watching unto pray'r,
    Where duty calls, or danger,
    Be never wanting there.

    4.
    Stand up!  stand up for Jesus!
    The strife will not be long;
    This day the noise of battle,
    The next the victor's song:
    To him that overcometh,
    A crown of life shall be;
    He with the King of Glory
    Shall reign eternally.
 
 

## 629.  Harvest Home
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14VB5WuNu_69G31pO11KYJcKF7RJ4yLqu/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    We plough the fields and scatter
    The good seed on the land,
    But it is fed and watered
    By God's almighty hand;
    He sends the snow in winter,
    The warmth to swell the grain,
    The breezes, and the sunshine,
    And soft, refreshing rain.

    Chorus:
    All good gifts around us,
    Are sent from heav'n above,
    Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord,
    For all His wondrous love.

    2.
    We thank Thee, loving Father,
    For all things bright and good,
    The seed time and the harvest,
    Our life, our health, our food.
    No wealth have we to offer,
    For all Thy love imparts,
    But that which Thou desirest,
    Our humble, thankful hearts.

    Chorus:  
    Best of all Thy blessings,
    To earth the Saviour came,
    That we may rise and win the prize,
    Of endless life with Him.

    3.
    Shall we not give for others,
    As God to us has giv'n,
    Own all mankind as brothers,
    And help them on to heav'n?
    We bring our offrings gladly,
    And speed the message on,
    Of Christ and His salvation,
    To all beneath the sun.

    Chorus:
    Quickly, blessed Master, 
    O may Thy kingdom come!
    At Thy command, in ev'ry land,
    We speed the "harvest home."
 
 

## 630.  The Fields Are White
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14VxY%2DRJRg6dGha2Te7pJxml8LuvcKTGR/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The fields are all white,
    And the reapers are few,
    We children are willing,
    But what can we do,
    To work for our Lord in His harvest?

    2.
    Our hands are so small,
    And our words are so weak,
    We cannot teach others;
    How then shall we seek
    To work for our Lord in His harvest?

    3.
    We'll work by our pray'rs,
    By the off'rings we bring,
    By small self-denials;
    The least little thing
    May work for our Lord in His harvest,

    4.
    Until, by and by,
    As the years pass at length,
    We too may be reapers,
    And go forth in strength
    To work for our Lord in His harvest.

    1.
    Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,
    Lead thou me on!
    The night is dark and I am far from home;
    Lead thou me on!
    Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see
    The distant scene; one step's enough for me.

    2.
    I was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou
    Shouldst lead me on;
    I loved to choose and see my path, but now
    Lead thou me on!
    I loved the garish day, and spite of fears,
    Pride ruled my will.  Remember not past years!

    3.
    So long thy power hath blest me, sure it still
    Will lead me on 
    O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till
    The night is gone,
    And with the morn those angel faces smile
    Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.

    Holy Spirit, faithful Guide,
    Ever near the Christian's side;
    Gently lead us by the hand,
    Pilgrims in a desert land;
    Weary souls for e'er rejoice,
    When they hear that sweetest voice,
    Whisper softly, "Wand'rer, come! 
    Follow me, I'll guide thee home."

    2.
    Ever present, truest friend,
    Ever near thine aid to lend,
    Leave us not to doubt and fear,
    Groping on in darkness drear;
    When the storms are raging sore,
    Hearts grow faint, and hopes give o'er,
    Whisper softly, "Wand'rer, come!
    Follow me, I'll guide thee home."

    3.
    When our days of toil shall cease,
    Waiting still for sweet release,
    Nothing left but heaven and prayer,
    Wond'ring if our names are there;
    Wading deep the dismal flood,
    Pleading nought but Jesus' blood,
    Whisper softly, "Wand'rer, come!
    Follow me, I'll guide thee home."

    1.
    Jesus, lover of my soul,
    Let me to Thy bosom fly,
    While the billows near me roll,
    While the tempest still is high!
    Hide me, O my Saviour hide,
    Till the storm of life be past;
    Safe into the haven guide;
    Oh, receive my soul at last!

    2.
    Other refuge have I none;
    Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
    Leave, O leave me not alone,
    Still support and comfort me.
    All my trust on Thee is stay'd,
    All my help from Thee I bring;
    Cover my defenceless head
    With the shadow of Thy wing.

    3.
    Thou, O Christ, art all I want,
    More than all in Thee I find;
    Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
    Heal the sick and lead the blind.
    Just and holy is Thy name;
    I am all unrighteousness;
    Vile and full of sin I am,
    Thou art full of truth and grace.

    4.
    Plenteous grace with thee is found,
    Grace to cover all my sin;
    Let the healing streams abound;
    Make and keep me pure within.
    Thou of life the fountain art,
    Freely let me take of Thee;
    Spring Thou up within my heart,
    Rise to all eternity!  Amen.

## 636.  The Watching Church
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11jWP6s3qu5_7jo%2DO_ZDJXMtmry%2Dfty_Q/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Lord, her watch Thy Church is keeping;
    When shall earth Thy rule obey?
    When shall end the night of weeping?
    When shall break the promised day?
    See the whit'ning harvest languish,
    Waiting still the lab'rers' toil;
    Was it vain, Thy Son's deep anguish!
    Shall the strong retain the spoil?

    2.
    Tidings, sent for ev'ry creature,
    Millions yet have never heard;
    Can they hear without a preacher?
    Lord Almighty, give the word;
    Give the word; in ev'ry nation
    Let the gospel trumpet sound,
    Witnessing of Thy salvation
    To the earth's remotest bound.

    3.
    Then the end:  Thy Church completed,
    All Thy chosen gathered in,
    With their King in glory seated,
    Satan bound, and banished sin;
    Gone forever, parting, weeping,
    Hunger, sorrow, death, and pain;
    Lo!  her watch Thy church is keeping,
    Come, Lord Jesus; come to reign.

    1.
    We are living, we are dwelling,
    In a grand and awful time,
    In an age on ages telling,
    To be living is sublime.
    Hark!  the waking up of nations,
    Gog and Magog to the fray;
    Hark!  what soundeth?  Is creation
    Groaning for her latter day?

    2.
    Christian, rouse and arm for conflict,
    Nerve thee for the battle field;
    Bear the helmet of salvation,
    And the mighty gospel shield;
    Bind the breastplate firmly on thee,
    Take the Spirit's sword in hand;
    Boldly, fearlessly, go forth then,
    In Jehovah's strength to stand.

    3.
    Wicked spirits gather round thee,
    Legions of those foes to God--
    Principalities most mighty--
    Walk unseen the earth abroad;
    They are gath'ring to the battle,
    Strengthen'd for the last deep strife;
    Christian, arm!  be watchful, ready,
    Struggle manfully for life.

    1.
    Lord, thou callest for the workers,
    Glad we come at thy command;
    Give us each the worker's outfit,
    Loving heart and ready hand.
    Great the honor, sweet the duty
    That thy love on us bestows,
    In the soul, howe'er unfertile,
    Planting Sharon's fadeless Rose!

    2.
    Bless our labors, God of heaven,
    Aid thy servants, Lord of earth,
    As we strive to set our garden
    With the plant of priceless worth!
    Patient all the day we labor,
    Still at night the tempter sows
    Tares of sin where we had planted
    Sharon's fair and fadeless Rose!

    3.
    Ours is toil that knows no season;
    Day and night to us are one;
    Winter is the same as summer;
    Ours is an eternal sun.
    So when heat of summer scorches,
    And when stormy winter blows.
    Still we toil within our garden,
    Planting Sharon's fadeless Rose!

    4.
    Wake, O North wind!  come, O South wind!
    O'er our garden softly blow;
    Bid the Rose's sacred perfume
    From our tender plants to flow.
    Come, Beloved, to thy garden;
    All its sweets to thee it owes;
    Shed thy holy fragrance o'er us,
    Sharon's fair and fadeless Rose!

    1.
    "Cast thy bread upon the waters,
    Ye who have but scant supply;
    Angel eyes will watch above it;
    You shall find it by and by;
    He who in his righteous balance,
    Doth each human action weigh,
    Will your sacrifice remember,
    Will your loving deeds repay.

    2.
    "Cast thy bread upon the waters;
    Sad and weary, worn with care,
    Wherefore sitting in the shadow?
    Surely you've a crumb to spare.
    Can you not to those around you
    Sing some little song of hope,
    As you look with longing vision
    Thro' faith's mighty telescope?

    3.
    "Cast thy bread upon the waters,"
    Ye who have abundant store;
    It may float on many a billow,
    It may strand on many a shore;
    You may think it lost forever,
    But, as sure as God is true,
    In this life, or in the other,
    It will yet return to you.
 
 

## 640.  Abide With Us

    1.
    Blessed Jesus, meek and lowly,
    With us here take thine abode;
    We would fain like thee be holy,
    Humbly walking with our God.
    We would thy sweet Spirit cherish,
    Welcome in our hearts thy stay;
    Lest without thine aid we perish,
    O, abide with us, we pray.

    2.
    Guide us in the path of heaven,
    Rugged tho' that path may be;
    Let each bitter cup that's given,
    Serve to draw us nearer thee.
    In thy footsteps traced before us,
    There we see earth's scorn and frown;
    There is suf'ring ere the glory,
    There's a cross before the crown.

    3.
    In thy vineyard let us labor,
    Of thy goodness let us tell;
    All is ill without thy favor,
    With thy presence all is well.
    While the ev'ning shadows gather,
    Thro' this dreary night of tears,
    Tarry with us, O our Saviour,
    Till the morning light appears.

    4.
    Then with thee may we forever
    Reign with all the good and blest,
    Where no sin from thee can sever,
    Where the weary are at rest.
    There to praise the matchless Giver,
    There with angels to adore
    Him who did thro' grace deliver
    Us from death forevermore.

    1.
    Hark!  the voice of Jesus calling,
    "Who will go and work to-day?
    Fields are white, the harvest waiting,
    Who will bear the sheaves away?"
    Loud and long the Master calleth,
    Rich reward he offers free;
    Who will answer, gladly saying,
    "Here am I, O Lord, send me?"

    2.
    If you can not cross the ocean
    And the heathen lands explore,
    You can find the heathen nearer,
    You can help them at your door;
    If you can not speak like angels,
    If you can not preach like Paul,
    You can tell the love of Jesus,
    You can say he died for all.

    3.
    If you can not be the watchman,
    Standing high on Zion's wall,
    Pointing out the path to heaven,
    Of'ring life and peace to all,
    With your pray'rs and with your bounties
    You can do what Heav'n demands,
    You can be like faithful Aaron,
    Holding up the prophet's hands.

    4.
    While the souls of men are dying,
    And the Master calls for you,
    Let none hear you idly saying,
    "There is nothing I can do!"
    Gladly take the task he gives you,
    Let his work your pleasure be;
    Answer quickly when he calleth,
    "Here am I, O Lord, send me."

    1.
    Pilgrims on!  the day is dawning;
    Strike your tents, and homeward haste:
    Sleep not while the blush of morning
    Calls you on the dessert waste.
    Tho' the way be dark and dreary,
    Life's sharp anguish must be borne.
    Courage, then, ye faint and weary,
    Linger not to weep and mourn.

    2.
    Pilgrims on!  the storm is beating,
    Beating wildly on your way:
    Tarry not, the time is fleeting;
    Shall the storm your footsteps stay?
    Hasten on, thro' joy and sorrow,
    Or whatever may betide,
    Wait not for the calm tomorrow,
    Faithful at your work abide.

    3.
    Pilgrim on!  what tho' in dangers,
    Life's eventful course pursue;
    Labor on, ye friendless strangers,
    Grace will guide you safely through.
    What if trials must befall you!
    What if fierce temptations rise!
    Shall earth's bitter strife appall you
    While contending for the prize?

    4.
    Pilgrims on!  there's rest in heaven,
    Rest from every anxious care,
    Rest in Jesus' smiles forgiven,
    Peaceful and eternal there.
    O, 't were sweet to toil in sadness,
    O, 't were well the cross to bear,
    If at last in joy and gladness
    We may rest forever there!

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12bTqSiSFXy3ecZxXd0FZA6lxoRTSZ3Uq/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    What a friend we have in Jesus,
    All our sins and griefs to bear!
    What a privilege to carry
    Ev'rything to God in pray'r!
    O what peace we often forfeit,
    O what needless pain we bear,
    All because we do not carry
    Ev'rything to God in pray'r!

    2.
    Have we trials and temptations?
    Is there trouble anywhere?
    We should never be discouraged,
    Take it to the Lord in pray'r.
    Can we find a friend so faithful,
    Who will all our sorrows share?
    Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness;
    Take it to the Lord in pray'r.

    3.
    Are we weak and heavy laden,
    Cumbered with a load of care?
    Precious Saviour, still our refuge,
    Take it to the Lord in pray'r;
    Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
    Take it to the Lord in pray'r;
    In his arms he'll take and shield thee;
    Thou wilt find a solace there.

    1.
    Courage, brother!  do not stumble,
    Tho' thy path be dark as night;
    There's a star to guide the humble:
    Trust in God, and do the right.
    Let the road be rough and dreary,
    And its end far out of sight,
    Foot it bravely; strong or weary,
    Trust in God, trust in God,
    Trust in God and do the right.

    2.
    Perish policy and cunning,
    Perish all that fears the light.
    Whether losing, whether winning,
    Trust in God, and do the right.
    Trust no party, sect, or faction;
    Trust no leaders in the fight;
    But in ev'ry word or action 
    Trust in God, trust in God,
    Trust in God and do the right.

    3.
    Some will hate thee, some will love thee,
    Some will flatter, some will slight;
    Cease from man, and look above thee:
    Trust in God, and do the right.
    Take His word for safest guiding,
    Inward peace, and inward might,
    Star upon our path abiding
    Trust in God, trust in God,
    Trust in God and do the right.

    God the all-terrible!  King who ordainest,
    Great winds Thy clarions, the lightnings Thy sword;
    Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reigned,
    Give to us peace, O most merciful Lord.

    2.
    God the all-merciful!  earth hath forsaken
    Thy precepts holy, and slighted Thy word;
    Bid not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken;
    Give to us peace, O most merciful Lord.

    3.
    God the all-righteous One!  man hath defied Thee,
    Yet to eternity standeth Thy word;
    Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside Thee;
    Prosper the right, O most merciful Lord.

    4.
    So shall we render Thee thankful devotion,
    For Thy deliv'rance from peril and sword,
    Singing in chorus from ocean to ocean,
    "Thine is the pow'r and the glory, O Lord."

    Darkness cannot hide from Thee;
    Thou art He who never weary,
    Watchest where Thy people be.

    2.
    Tho' destruction walk around me,
    Tho' the arrow past us fly,
    Angel guards from Thee surround us;
    We are safe, if Thou art nigh.
    Should swift death this night o'ertake us,
    And our couch become our tomb,
    May the morn of glory wake us,
    Clad in heav'n's eternal bloom.  Amen.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12piSbX426TurVyNfvnY_mlt9iOP1IeSx/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
    O what words I hear him say!
    Happy place!  so near, so precious!
    May it find me there each day;
    Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
    I would look upon the past,
    For his love has been so gracious,
    It has won my heart at last.

    2.
    Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
    Where can mortal be more blest?
    There I lay my sins and sorrows,
    And, when weary, find sweet rest;
    Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
    There I love to weep and pray,
    While I from his fulness gather
    Grace and comfort ev'ry day.

    3.
    Bless me, O my Saviour, bless me,
    As I'm waiting at thy feet,
    O look down in love upon me,
    Let me see thy face so sweet;
    Give me, Lord, the mind of Jesus,
    Make me holy as he is,
    May I prove I've been with Jesus,
    Who is all my righteousness.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ox92bcy_ct%2DeX0BfbltAaHsPT0RsG7I/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There is never a day so dreary,
    But God can make it bright;
    And to the soul that trusts him,
    He giveth pure delight;
    There is never a path so hidden,
    But God will show the way,
    If we will seek his guidance,
    And patiently will pray.

    2.
    There is never a cross so heavy,
    But Jesus' hands are there,
    Outstretched in sweet compassion,
    Our burden still to bear;
    There is never a life so darkened,
    So hopeless, so unblest,
    But may be fill'd with gladness,
    In Jesus' peace may rest.

    3.
    There is never a heart so broken,
    But Jesus Christ can heal;
    The heart once pierced on Calv'ry
    Doth for his people feel;
    He will never fulfill his promise,
    His word can never fail;
    God is our help in trouble,
    Our strength when foes assail.

    I love thee my Saviour, I love thee, my God.
    I love thee, I love thee, and that thou dost know;
    But how much I love then my actions will show.

    2.
    I'm happy, I'm happy, O, wondrous account!
    My joys are immortal, I stand on the mount!
    I gaze on my treasure and long to be there,
    With Jesus and angels, and kindred so dear.

    3.
    O Jesus, my Saviour, with thee I am blest,
    My life and salvation, my joy and my rest.
    Thy love be my story, thy name be my song;
    Thy grace shall inspire both my heart and my tongue.

    4.
    O, who's like my Saviour?  he's Salem's bright King;
    He smiles, and he loves me, and helps me to sing.
    I'll praise him, I'll praise him with notes loud and clear,
    While rivers of pleasure my spirit do cheer.

    His adorable will let us gladly fulfill,
    And our talents improve,

    Our life as a dream, our time as a stream,
    Glides swiftly away,
    And the fugitive moment refuses to stay,
    And the fugitive moment refuses to stay.

    4.
    O, that each in the day of His coming may say,
    "I have fought my way thro':
    I have finished the work thou didst give me to do,
    I have finished the work thou didst give me to do."

    5.
    O, that each from his Lord may receive the glad word,
    "Well and faithfully done! 
    Enter into my joy, and sit down on my throne,
    Enter into my joy, and sit down on my throne."
 
 

## 652.  Pilot Me
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17%2DDtD%2DD_0NjgNY2mVqzJpPe3xH6SGCid/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jesus, Saviour, pilot me
    Over life's tempestuous sea;
    Unknown waves before me roll,
    Hiding rock and treach'rous shoal;
    Chart and compass came from thee;
    Jesus, Saviour, pilot me.

    2.
    As a mother stills her child,
    Thou canst calm the ocean wild;
    Boist'rous waves obey thy will
    When thou say'st to them, "Be still!"
    Wond'rous Sov'reign of the sea,
    Jesus, Saviour, pilot me.

    3.
    When at last I near the shore,
    And the fearful breakers roar
    'Tween me and the peaceful rest,
    Then, while leaning on thy breast,
    May I hear thee say to me,
    "Fear not, I will pilot thee."
 
 

## 653.  Till He Come
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/170rFyqmyyenxK%2D17GOFaozLsquVK%2DooU/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    "Till He come!"  O let the words
    Linger on the trembling chords;
    Let the "little while" between,
    In their golden light be seen;
    Let us think how heav'n and home
    Lie beyond that "Till He come!"

    2.
    When the weary ones we love,
    From the cares of earth remove,
    When their words of hope and cheer
    Fall no longer on our ear,
    Hush!  be ev'ry murmur dumb,
    It is only "Till He come!"

    3.
    Clouds and darkness round us press;
    Would we have one sorrow less?
    All the sharpness of the cross,
    All that tells the world is loss,
    Death and darkness and the tomb,
    Pain us only "Till He come!"
 
 

## 654.  Rock of Ages
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16iG2xEaghOFEhiNoBKJGNwtEuDUEdX3X/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me!
    Let me hide myself in thee;
    Let the water and the blood,
    From thy riven side that flowed,
    Be of sin the double cure;
    Save me from its guilt and pow'r.

    2.
    Not the labor of my hands
    Can fulfil thy law's demands;
    Could my zeal no respite know,
    Could my tears forever flow,
    All for sin could not atone;
    Thou must save, and thou alone.

    3.
    Nothing in my hand I bring
    Simply to thy cross I cling;
    Naked, come to thee for dress,
    Helpless, look to thee for grace;
    Foul, I to the Fountain fly,
    Wash me, Saviour, or I die.

    4.
    While I draw this fleeting breath,
    When mine eyes shall close in death,
    When I soar to world's unknown,
    See thee on thy Judgment throne,
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in thee.
 
 

## 655.  Abide With Me
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/172ep3%2DcCqY0COTxt_deuUiAI1_FgSJka/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Abide with me!  Fast falls the eventide;
    The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
    When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
    Help of the helpless, O, abide with me!

    2.
    Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
    Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
    Change and decay in all around I see;
    O thou who changest not, abide with me!

    3.
    Not a brief glance I ask, nor passing word,
    But as thou dwell'st with thy disciples, Lord,
    Familiar, condescending, patient, free,
    Come, not to sojourn, but abide with me!

    4.
    I need thy presence ev'ry passing hour;
    What but thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r.
    Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be?
    Thro' cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me!

    5.
    I fear no foe, with thee at hand to bless;
    Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;
    Where is death's sting?  where, grave, thy victory?
    I triumph still, if thou abide with me.
 
 

## 656.  'Onward, Christian Soldiers'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16RtscdgErht3gFg7ip2k3Hn4UH8CqA3C/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Onward, Christian soldiers!
    Marching as to war,
    With the cross of Jesus
    Going on before.
    Christ the royal Master,
    Leads against the foe,
    Forward into battle, 
    See his banners go!

    Chorus:
    Onward, Christian soldiers!
    Marching as to war,
    With the cross of Jesus 
    Going on before.

    2.
    At the sign of triumph
    Satan's host doth feel,
    On then Christian soldiers,
    On to victory!
    Hell's foundations quiver
    At the shout of praise,
    Brothers, lift your voices, 
    Loud your anthems raise.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Like a mighty army
    Moves the Church of God;
    Brothers we are treading
    Where the saints have trod;
    We are not divided,
    All one body we,
    One in hope and doctrine,
    One in charity.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Crowns and thrones have perished,
    Kingdoms ruled and waned,
    But the Church of Jesus
    Constant has remained.
    Gates of hell can never
    'Gainst that Church prevail;
    We have Christ's own promise,
    That can never fail.  [Chorus]

    5.
    Onward, then, ye people!
    Join our happy throng,
    Blend with ours your voices
    In the triumph song;
    Glory, praise, and honor
    Unto Christ the King;
    This thro' countless ages 
    Men and angels sing.  [Chorus]
 
 

## 657.  Our Banner
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16k2DjLQL_PYLb3dWpzOakzvcfTji%2DGTh/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Brightly gleams our banner,
    Pointing to the sky,
    Waving wand'rers onward,
    To their home on high;
    Journ'ying o'er the desert,
    Gladly thus we pray,
    And with hearts united,
    Take our heav'nward way.

    Chorus:
    Brightly gleams our banner,
    Pointing to the sky,
    Waving wand'rers onward
    To their home on high.

    2.
    Jesus, Lord and Master;
    At Thy sacred feet,
    Here with hearts rejoicing,
    See Thy children meet;
    Often have we left Thee,
    Often gone astray,
    Keep us, mighty Saviour,
    In the narrow way.  [Chorus]

    3.
    All our days direct us
    In the way we go,
    Lead us on victorious,
    Over every foe;
    Bid Thine angels shield us,
    When the storm clouds low'r,
    Pardon Thou, and save us
    In the final hour.  [Chorus]

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16U1k_RrCY0y6nDRjz7P4HSqO6D35CQui/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Forward!  be our watchword,
    Steps and voices joined;
    Seek the things before us,
    Not a look behind;
    Burns the fiery pillar, 
    At our army's head,
    Who shall dream of shrinking,
    By our Captain led?

    Refrain:
    Forward!  in the conflict,
    Thro' the toil and fight,
    Foes must fall before us,
    God will speed the right.

    2.
    Forward out of error,
    Leave behind the night;
    Forward thro' the darkness,
    Forward into light!
    Glories upon glories
    Hath our God prepared,
    By the souls that love Him
    One day to be shared!  [Refrain]

    3.
    Far o'er yon horizon
    Rise the city towers,
    Where our God abideth;
    That fair home is ours!
    Thither, onward thither,
    In the Spirit's might,
    Lovers of your country,
    Forward into light!  [Refrain]
 
 

## 659.  On Our Way Rejoicing
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16YX8jW%2D8Flq80OaJa1VF1ZJicQF6uVhx/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    On our way rejoicing,
    As we homeward move,
    Hearken to our praises,
    O thou God of love!
    Is there grief or sadness?
    Thine it cannot be!
    Is our sky beclouded?
    Clouds are not from Thee!

    Refrain:
    On our way rejoicing,
    As we homeward move,
    Hearken to our praises,
    O Thou God of love!

    2.
    If with honest-hearted
    Love for God and man,
    Day by day Thou find us
    Doing what we can;
    Thou who giv'st the seed-time
    Wilt give large increase,
    Crown the head with blessings
    Fill the heart with peace.  [Refrain]

    3.
    On our way rejoicing
    Gladly let us go;
    Conquered hath our leader,
    Vanquished is our foe!
    Christ without, our safety;
    Christ within, our joy;
    Who, if we be faithful,
    Can our hope destroy?  [Refrain]

    4.
    Unto God the Father
    Joyful songs we sing;
    Unto God the Saviour
    Thankful hearts we bring.
    Unto God the Spirit
    Bow we and adore,
    On our way rejoicing
    Now and evermore!  [Refrain]
 
 

## 660.  As Thou Wilt
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16mPIA0cjcYOKVBv6s0OmiNSOBKwjKEcz/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    My Jesus, as thou wilt:
    O may thy will be mine!
    Into thy hand of love 
    I would, my all resign.
    Thro' sorrow or thro' joy,
    Conduct me as thine own,
    And help me still to say,
    "My Lord, thy will be done."

    2.
    My Jesus, as thou wilt:
    Tho' seen thro' many a tear,
    Let not my star of hope
    Grow dim or disappear.
    Since thou on earth hast wept
    And sorrowed oft alone,
    If I must weep with thee,
    "My Lord, thy will be done."

    3.
    My Jesus, as thou wilt:
    All shall be well for me;
    Each changing future scene
    I gladly trust with thee.
    Straight to my home above,
    I travel calmly on,
    And sing in life or death,
    "My Lord, thy will be done."
 
 

## 661.  Not My Way
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/113ND0uZSMoPNX0NKT6cfLqQYEP9H8uFl/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Thy way, not mine, O Lord,
    However dark it be;
    Lead me by thine own hand,
    And choose the path for me.
    I dare not choose my lot;
    I would not if I might;
    Choose thou for me, my God, 
    So shall I walk aright.

    2.
    The kingdom that I seek
    Is thine; so let the way
    That leads to it be thine,
    Else I must surely stray.
    Hold thou my cup of life;
    With joy or sorrow fill
    As best to thee may seem:
    Choose thou my good and ill.

    3.
    Choose thou for me my friends,
    My sickness or my health;
    Choose thou my cares for me,
    My poverty or wealth.
    Not mine, not mine the choice,
    In either great or small;
    Be thou my Guide, my Strength, 
    My Wisdom, and my All.
 
 

## 662.  I Follow On
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10LovYTnowVm_rDXm8d20UvR_keMxY5Js/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Saviour!  I follow on,
    Guided by thee,
    Seeing not yet the hand
    That leadeth me;
    Hushed be my heart, and still,
    Fear I no further ill;
    Only to meet thy will
    My will shall be.

    2.
    Riven the Rock for me,
    Thirst to relieve,
    Manna from heaven falls
    Fresh ev'ry eve;
    Never a want severe
    Causeth mine eye a tear,
    But thou dost whisper near,
    "Only believe!"

    3.
    Often to Marah's brink
    Have I been bro't;
    Shrinking the cup to drink,
    Help I have sought;
    And with the prayer's ascent,
    Jesus the branch hath rent
    Quickly relief hath sent,
    Sweet'ning the draught.

    4.
    Saviour!  I long to walk
    Closer with thee;
    Led by thy guiding hand,
    Ever to be
    Constantly near thy side,
    Quickened and purified,
    Living for him who died
    Freely for me.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10lTPAYBHsP6WIubxVQhYy_G%2D7DheXLoJ/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer to thee!
    E'en tho' it be a cross
    That raiseth me!
    Still all my song shall be,
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer, my God, to thee, 
    Nearer to thee.

    2.
    Tho' like a wanderer,
    Daylight all gone,
    Darkness be over me,
    My rest a stone;
    Yet in my dreams I'd be
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer to thee.

    3.
    There let the way appear,
    Steps up to heav'n,
    All that thou sendest me,
    In mercy giv'n;
    Angels to beckon me
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer to thee.

    4.
    Then, with my waking tho'ts
    Bright with thy praise,
    Out of my stony griefs
    Bethel I'll raise;
    So by my woes to be
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer to thee.

    5.
    Or if, on joyful wing
    Cleaving the sky,
    Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
    Upward I fly,
    Still all my song shall be,
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Near to thee.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10T_IE1D5BA6EgNde_CEV63Cp4k6GUQxk/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord
    Is laid for your faith in his excellent word!
    What more can he say than to you he hath said
    Who unto the Saviour for refuge have fled,
    Who unto the Saviour for refuge have fled?

    2.
    "When thro' the deep waters I call thee to go,
    The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;
    For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,
    And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress,
    And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress."

    3.
    "When thro' fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
    My grace all-sufficient shall be thy supply;
    The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
    Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine,
    Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine."

    4.
    "The soul that on Jesus doth lean for repose,
    I will not, I will not, desert to his foes;
    That soul, tho' all hell should endeavor to shake,
    I'll never, no never, no never forsake,
    I'll never, no never, no never forsake."

    1.
    The Lord is my Shepherd, no want shall I know;
    I feed in green pastures, safe folded I rest;
    He leadeth my soul where the still waters flow,
    Restores me when wand'ring, redeems when oppressed.

    2.
    Thro' the valley and shadow of death tho' I stray,
    Since thou art my Guardian, no evil I fear;
    Thy rod shall defend me, thy staff be my stay,
    No harm can befall, with my Comforter near.

    3.
    In the midst of affliction my table is spread,
    With blessings unmeasured my cup runneth o'er;
    With perfume and oil thou annointest my head;
    O, what shall I ask of thy providence more?

    4.
    Let goodness and mercy, my bountiful God,
    Still follow my steps till I meet thee above;
    I seek by the path which my forefathers trod,
    Thro' the land of their sojourn thy kingdom of love.

    1.
    Tho' faint, yet pursuing, we go on our way;
    The Lord is our Leader, His word is our stay;
    Tho' suff'ring and sorrow, and trial be near,
    The Lord is our Refuge, and whom can we fear?
    The Lord is our Refuge, and whom can we fear?

    2.
    He raiseth the fallen, He cheereth the faint;
    The weak and afflicted, He hears their complaint;
    The way may be weary, and thorny the road,
    But how can we falter?  our help is in God!
    But how can we falter?  our help is in God!

    3.
    And to His green pastures our footsteps He leads:
    His flock in the desert how kindly He feeds!
    The lambs in His bosom He tenderly bears,
    And brings back the wand'rers all safe from the snares,
    And brings back the wand'rers all safe from the snares.

    4.
    Tho' clouds may surround us, our God is our light;
    Tho' foes would confound us, our God is our might;
    So, faint yet pursuing, still onward we come;
    The Lord is our Leader, and heaven our home!
    The Lord is our Leader, and heaven our home!

    1.
    Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,
    When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;
    Fairer than morning, lovelier than the daylight,
    Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee!

    2.
    Alone with Thee, amid the mystic shadows,
    The solemn hush of nature newly born;
    Alone with Thee, in holy adoration,
    In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.

    3.
    As in the dawning, o'er the waveless ocean,
    The image of the morning star doth rest;
    So in this stillness Thou beholdest only 
    Thine image mirrored in my peaceful breast.

    4.
    When sinks the soul, subdued by toil, to slumber,
    Its closing eye looks up to Thee in pray'r;
    Sweet the repose beneath Thy wings o'ershading,
    But sweeter still, to wake and find Thee there.

    5.
    So shall it be at last, in that bright morning,
    When the soul waketh, and life's shadows flee;
    Oh, in that glad hour, fairer than day dawning,
    Shall rise the glorious tho't, I am with Thee!

    1.
    Lead Thou me on, and then my feet tho' weary,
    Shall never falter in life's rugged way;
    And tho' my pathway lead thro' wilds most dreary,
    Guided by thee my feet shall never stray.

    2.
    Fill me with love, and then my life shall ever
    Show forth the light of Thy sweet love divine;
    And tho' this world my heart from Thee would sever,
    I still rejoice in knowing Thou art mine.

    3.
    Give me Thy grace, the grace that more aboundeth
    When all the hosts of sin upon me roll;
    And tho' life's care my lonely way surroundeth,
    Still I can rest, if Thou my life control.

    4.
    Give me Thy peace that passeth understanding,
    And wraps the soul in calm and sweet repose;
    And tho' the storms would keep my soul from landing,
    At length I'll anchor, safe from all my foes.

    5.
    Lord, well I know, all these, and more are given,
    With Christ in whom all heav'nly riches dwell;
    In Him by faith I grasp the joys of heaven,
    And taste the bliss my tongue now fails to tell.

    Redeemed at countless cost,
    From dark despair.

    3.
    Christ for the world we sing;
    The world to Christ we bring,

    The newborn souls, whose days,
    Reclaimed from error's ways,
    Inspired with hope and praise,

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16OtgQ5MdqA4VFObiumsdjaZ9ZiyFiyFV/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Holy Saviour, Friend unseen,
    Since on Thine arm Thou bidds't me lean,
    Help me, thro'out life's varying scene,
    By faith to cling to Thee.

    2.
    Blest with this fellowship Divine,
    Take what Thou wilt, I'll ne'er repine;
    E'en as the branches to the vine,
    My soul would cling to Thee.

    3.
    What tho' the world deceitful prove,
    And earthly friends and joys remove,
    With patient, uncomplaining love
    Still would I cling to Thee.

    4.
    Blest is my lot, whate'er befall;
    What can disturb me, who appall,
    While as my strength, my Rock, my All,
    Saviour, I cling to Thee?
 
 

## 672.  'Love''s Incense'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17CBwiijFQuKyA2jMg4txNo6lB1HBeQlx/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Master, no offering  
    Costly or sweet,
    Lay we, like Magdalene,
    Here at Thy feet;
    Yet may love's incense rise,
    Sweeter than sacrifice,
    Dear Lord, to Thee, 
    Dear Lord, to Thee.

    2.
    Daily our lives would show
    Weakness made strong,
    Toilsome and gloomy ways
    Brightened with song;
    Some deeds of kindness done,
    Some souls by patience won,
    Dear Lord, to Thee, 
    Dear Lord, to Thee.

    3.
    Some word of hope, for hearts
    Burdened with fears,
    Some balm of peace, for eyes
    Blinded with tears,
    Some dews of mercy shed,
    Some wayward footsteps led,
    Dear Lord, To Thee, 
    Dear Lord, to Thee.

    4.
    Thus, in Thy service, Lord,
    Till eventide 
    Closes the day of life,
    May we abide.
    And when earth's labor's cease,
    Bid us depart in peace,
    Dear Lord, to Thee, 
    Dear Lord, to Thee.

    1.
    Answer the call, ye brave men,
    The Master's call to save men;
    Each moment death is gaining,
    Their blood our garments staining:

    Chorus:
    Who'll go?  who'll go, whate'er the cost?
    Who'll go?  who'll go to save the lost?

    2.
    Lighting the world with glory,
    Once more the gospel story
    In purity and pow'r
    Proclaims the judgment hour:  [Chorus]

    3.
    Nations afar are waking,
    Their idol shrines forsaking;
    God's truth puts on its splendor,
    Immanuel its defender:  [Chorus]

    4.
    Bearing the name of Jesus,
    Whose great salvation frees us,
    With joy the good news carry, 
    Nor dare to longer tarry:  [Chorus]

    5.
    Where icy winds are crying,
    Where India's poor are dying,
    Where Southern seas are sleeping,
    Where Western isles are weeping.  

    Chorus:  I go, I go, whate'er the cost;
    I go, I go to save the lost.

    1.
    When storms of life are sweeping,
    When lonely watch I'm keeping,
    When floods of ill are falling,
    And tempter voices calling,

    Chorus:  
    Remember me, O Mighty One!
    Remember me, O Mighty One!

    2.
    When walking on life's ocean,
    Control its raging motion;
    When from its dangers shrinking,
    When 'neath the billows sinking.  [Chorus]

    3.
    When weight of care oppresses,
    When thought of sin distresses;
    Through all the life that's mortal,
    And when I pass death's portal.  [Chorus]
 
 

## 675.  The Lord My Trust
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Q39OHDTs4JZ45hgLxBV2oU_eKCm5ZQa/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The Lord my pasture shall prepare,
    And feed me with a shepherd's care;
    His presence shall my wants supply,
    And guard me with a watchful eye;
    My noonday walks he shall attend,
    And all my midnight hours defend.

    2.
    When on the sultry globe I faint,
    Or, on the thirsty mountain pant,
    To fertile vales and dewy meads
    My weary, wand'ring steps he leads
    Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow,
    Amid the verdant landscape flow.

    3.
    Tho' in the paths of death I tread,
    With gloomy horrors overspread,
    My steadfast heart shall fear no ill,
    For thou, O Lord, art with me still;
    Thy friendly staff shall give me aid,
    And guide me thro' the dreadful shade.

    Amen.

    Eternal Father!  strong to save,
    Whose arm doth bind the restless wave,
    Who bidst the mighty ocean deep
    Its own appointed limits keep:
    O hear us when we cry to thee
    For those in peril on the sea!

    2.
    O Saviour!  whose almighty word
    The winds and waves submissive heard,
    Who walkedst on the foaming deep,
    And calm amidst its rage didst sleep:
    O hear us when, etc.

    3.
    O Sacred Spirit!  who didst brood
    Upon the chaos dark and rude,

    And gavest light and life and peace:

    O words with heav'nly comfort fraught!
    Whate'er I do, where'er I be,
    Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

    Chorus:
    He leadeth me, he leadeth me,
    By his own hand he leadeth me:
    His faithful fol'wer I would be,
    For by his hand he leadeth me.

    2.
    Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,
    Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,
    By waters still, o'er troubled sea,
    Still 'tis his hand that leadeth me.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Lord, I would clasp thy hand in mine,
    Nor ever murmur or repine,
    Content whatever lot I see,
    Since 'tis my God that leadeth me.  [Chorus]

    4.
    And when my task on earth is done,
    When by thy grace the vict'ry's won,
    E'en death's cold wave I will not flee,
    Since God thro' Jordan leadeth me.  [Chorus]

    Faith of our fathers!  living still
    In spite of dungeon, fire, and sword:
    O how our hearts beat high with joy
    Whene'er we hear that glorious word:
    Faith of our fathers!  holy faith!
    We will be true to thee till death!

    2.
    Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
    Were still in heart and conscience free:
    How sweet would be their children's fate,
    If they, like them, could die for thee!
    Faith of our fathers!  holy faith!
    We will be true to thee till death!

    3.
    Faith of our fathers!  we will love
    Both friend and foe in all our strife;

    By kindly words and virtuous life.
    Faith of our fathers!  holy faith!
    We will be true to thee till death!

    1.
    Heir of the kingdom, O why dost thou slumber?
    Why art thou sleeping so near thy blest home?
    Wake thee, arouse thee, and gird on thine armor,
    Speed, for the moments are hurrying on.

    2.
    Earth's mighty nations, in strife and commotion,
    Tremble with terror, and sink in dismay;
    Listen, 'tis naught but the chariot's loud rumbling;
    Heir of the kingdom, no longer delay.

    3.
    Stay not, O stay not for earth's vain allurements!
    See how its glory is passing away;
    Break the strong fetters the foe hath bound o'er thee;
    Heir of the kingdom, turn, turn thee away.

    4.
    Keep the eye single, the head upward lifted;
    Watch for the glory of earth's coming King;
    Lo!  o'er the mountaintops light is now breaking;
    Heir of the kingdom, rejoice ye and sing.

    1.
    Christian, the morn breaks sweetly o'er thee
    And all the midnight shadows flee;
    Ting'd are the distant skies with glory,
    A beacon light hangs out for thee.
    Arise!  arise!  the light breaks o'er thee,
    Thy name is graven on the throne;
    Thy home is in that world of glory
    Where thy Redeemer reigns alone.

    2.
    Toss'd on the rude, relentless surges,
    Calmly compos'd and dauntless, stand;
    For lo, beyond these scenes emerges
    The hights that bound the promis'd land.
    Behold!  behold!  the land is nearing,
    Where storms of evil rage no more;
    Hark, how the heav'nly hosts are cheering!
    See in what throngs they range the shore.

    3.
    Cheer up, cheer up, the day breaks o'er thee,
    Bright as the summer's noontide ray;
    The starry crowns and realms of glory
    Invite thy happy soul away.
    Away!  away!  leave all for glory,
    Thy name is graven on the throne,
    Thy home is in that world of beauty
    Where thy Redeemer reigns alone.
 
 

## 681.  A Mighty Fortress
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15TakTmjsFGeRZw1GO4PrYqj3ds%2D_0wsc/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    A mighty fortress is our God,
    A bulwark never failing;
    Our helper he, amid the flood
    Of mortal ills prevailing.
    For still our ancient foe
    Doth seek to work his woe;
    His craft and pow'r are great,
    And arm'd with cruel hate;
    On earth is not his equal.

    2.
    Did we in our own strength confide,
    Our striving would be losing;
    Were not the right Man on our side,
    The Man of God's own choosing.
    Doth ask who that may be?
    Christ Jesus, it is he!
    Lord Sabaoth is his name,
    From age to age the same;
    And he must win the battle.

    3.
    And tho' this world, with devils filled,
    Should threaten to undo us,
    We will not fear, for God hath will'd
    His truth to triumph thro' us.
    Let goods and kindred go,
    This mortal life also;
    The body they may kill;
    God's truth abideth still,
    His kingdom is forever.
 
 

## 682.  'Rise, My Soul'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15FuFsz6spqGucPAUKzoPMDk2KQMRZ9sv/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,
    Thy better portion trace;
    Rise from transitory things
    Tow'rds heav'n thy native place.
    Sun and moon and stars decay,
    Time shall soon this earth remove;
    Rise, my soul, and haste away
    To joys prepared above.

    2.
    Rivers to the ocean run,
    Nor stay in all their course;
    Fire ascending seeks the sun;
    Both speed them to their source:
    So my soul, derived from God.
    Pants to view His glorious face,
    Forward tends to His abode,
    To rest in His embrace.

    3.
    Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn,
    Press onward to the prize;
    Soon our Saviour will return
    Triumphant in the skies.
    Yet a season, and you know
    Happy entrance will be giv'n,
    All our sorrows left below,
    And earth exchanged for heav'n.

    1.
    Watchman, blow the gospel trumpet,
    Ev'ry soul a warning give;
    Whosoever hears the message
    May repent, and turn, and live.

    Chorus:
    Blow the trumpet, trusty watchman,
    Blow it loud o'er land and sea;
    God commissions, sound the message!
    Ev'ry captive may be free.

    2.
    Sound it loud o'er ev'ry hilltop,
    Gloomy shade, and sunny plain;
    Ocean depths repeat the message,
    Full salvation's glad refrain.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Sound it in the hedge and highway,
    Earth's dark spots where exiles roam;
    Let it tell all things are ready,
    Father waits to welcome home.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Sound it for the heavy laden,
    Weary, longing to be free.
    Sound a Saviour's invitation,
    Sweetly saying, "Come to me."  [Chorus]

    1.
    Words of cheer from the battlefield of life,
    Welcome tidings from the war;
    Glorious news from the grand and holy strife,
    Soon the conflict will be o'er.

    Chorus:
    Words of battle cheer!  tidings from the war!
    "How has gone the conflict?"  Vict'ry's near;
    Words of battle cheer!  tidings from the war!
    Glorious news of vict'ry!  Words of cheer.

    2.
    Fierce and long has the struggle been with sin,
    Still the Church moves on below;
    War without and temptation from within,
    Vainly seek her overthrow.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Stand like men!  there's a battle to be fought;
    All the hosts of hell will rage;
    Trust in God!  he deliverance has wrought
    For his saints in ev'ry age.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Who so strong as to trust in self alone
    'Gainst a foe so swift and sure?
    Who so weak that he can not grasp the Throne
    And the promised help secure?  [Chorus]

    1.
    Cast thy burden on the Lord,
    Cast thy burden on the Lord.
    Cast thy burden on the Lord,
    And he will sustain thee, and strengthen thee, and comfort thee;
    He still sustain thee, and comfort thee,
    He will sustain thee, and comfort thee.
    He will sustain thee, He will comfort thee;
    Cast thy burden on the Lord,
    Cast thy burden on the Lord.
    He will sustain thee, He will comfort thee,
    Cast thy burden on the Lord,
    Cast thy burden on the Lord.
 
 

## 686.  We Lay Us Down to Sleep
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15eHnXptHEmamfQ9r0T7M4PWqodZHby%2Da/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    We lay us calmly down to sleep
    When friendly night is come, and leave
    To God the rest;
    Whether we wake to smile or weep,
    Or wake no more on time's fair shore,
    He knoweth best, He knoweth best.
    O Father, us in safety keep!
    We lay us down to sleep.

    2.
    As sinks the sun in western skies
    When day is done, and twilight dim
    Comes silent on,
    So fades the world's most luring prize
    On eyes that close in deep repose
    Till wakes the dawn, Till wakes the dawn.
    O Father, us in safety keep!
    We lay us down to sleep.

    3.
    Why vex our souls with wearing care?
    Why shun the grave, for aching head
    So cool and low?
    Have we found life so passing fair,
    So grand to be, so sweet that we
    Should dread to go?  Should dread to go?
    O Father, us in safety keep!
    We lay us down to sleep.

    4.
    Some other hand the task can take,
    If so it seemeth best, the task
    By us begun;
    No work for which we need to wake
    In joy or grief, for life so brief,
    Beneath the sun, Beneath the sun.
    O Father, us in safety keep!
    We lay us down to sleep.

    1.
    Eternal depth of love divine,
    In Jesus, God with us, displayed,
    How brightly thy beaming glories shine!
    How wide thy healing streams are spread,
    How wide thy healing streams are spread!

    2.
    With whom dost thou delight to dwell?
    Sinner, a vile and thankless race!
    O God, what tongue aright can tell
    How vast thy love, how great thy grace?
    How vast thy love, how great thy grace?

    3.
    The dictates of thy sov'reign will
    With joy our grateful hearts receive;
    All thy delight in us fulfill:
    Lo, all we are, to thee we give;
    Lo, all we are, to thee we give.

    4.
    To thy sure love, thy tender care,
    Our flesh, soul, spirit, we resign;
    O, fix thy sacred presence there,
    And seal th' abode forever thine!
    And seal th' abode forever thine!

    1.
    God is our refuge and defense,
    In trouble our unfailing aid;
    Secure in his omnipotence
    What foe can make our souls afraid?

    2.
    Yea, tho' the earth's foundations rock,
    And mountains down the gulf be hurled,
    His people smile amid the shock;
    They look beyond this transient world.

    3.
    Built by the word of his command,
    Ten thousand worlds on nothing rest;
    All living things are in his hand,
    And he who trusts his word is blest.

    The creature of thy hand,
    On thee alone I live;

    More praise than I can give;
    My God, thy benefits demand

    3.
    Lord, what can I impart
    When all is thine before?
    Thy love demands a thankful heart;
    The gift, alas!  how poor;
    Thy love demands a thankful heart;
    The gift, alas!  how poor.

    The zephyrs seem to float to me
    Sweet sounds of heaven's melody,
    As angels with the white-rob'd throng
    Join in the sweet redemption song.  [Chorus]

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DmZUyW_GSCW3UTEqiK7nKnuGG2Gu2VCS/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I am dwelling on the mountain,
    Where the golden sunlight gleams
    O'er a land whose wondrous beauty
    Far exceeds my fondest dreams,
    Where the air is pure ethereal,
    Laden with the breath of flow'rs.
    They are blooming by th' fountain,
    Neath the amarinthin' bow'rs.

    2.
    I can see far down the pathway,
    Where I wandered weary years,
    Often hindered in my journey
    By the ghosts of doubts and fears;
    Broken vows and disappointments
    Thickly lie along the way;
    But the Spirit gently led me
    To the land I hold to-day.

    3.
    I am drinking at the fountain,
    Where I ever would abide;
    For I've tasted life's pure river,
    And my soul is satisfied;
    There's no thirst for worldly pleasures,
    Nor adorning rich and gay.
    For I've found a greater treasure,
    One that fadeth not away.

    4.
    Is not this the land of Beulah,
    Blessed land of love and light,
    Where the flowers blooom forever,
    And the sun is always bright?
    Yes, I've reached the land of Beulah,
    Blessed land of love and light.
    Here the flowers bloom forever.
    And the sun is always bright.

    1.
    The Son of God goes forth to war,
    A kingly crown to gain;
    His blood-red banner streams afar;
    Who follows in His train?
    Who best can drink His cup of woe,
    Triumphant over pain;
    Who patient bears His cross below,
    He follows in His train.

    2.
    The martyr first, whose eagle eye
    Could pierce beyond the grave,
    Who saw His Master in the sky,
    And called on Him to save;
    Like Him, with pardon on His tongue
    In midst of mortal pain,
    He pray'd for them that did the wrong:
    Who follows in His train?

    3.
    A glorious band, the chosen few
    On whom the spirit came,
    Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew,
    And mocked the cross and flame:
    They met the tyrant's brandished steel,
    The lion's gory mane;
    They bowed their necks the death to feel;
    Who follows in their train?

    4.
    A noble army, men and boys,
    The matron and the maid;
    Around the Saviour's throne rejoice,
    In robes of light arrayed:
    They climb'd the steep ascent of heav'n
    Thro' peril, toil, and pain:
    O God, to us may grace be giv'n
    To follow in their train.
 
 

## 694.  The Needy Poor
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Lmn2hWYKh%2DD%2DM7se%2Dz6J7ybdZCKcooD/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Christian, if the needy poor
    Have e'er unheeded been,
    Beware, lest at thy closed door
    The Saviour stood unseen!
    Let heart and house be open thrown,
    Thy gifts with others share;
    Let holy charity be shown
    To all who need thy care.

    2.
    Then, while thy glance abroad is cast,
    The Lord is by thy side;
    For thro' the open door He passed,
    When they were not denied.
    And ere thy kindly heart could guess
    Who entered by the door,
    His gracious hands were raised to bless
    Thy basket and thy store.

    3.
    And He shall bless thee all life's day,
    With His almighty love;
    And crown thee in eternity
    That waits the just above,
    Where soon the pearly gates of light
    His hand shall open throw
    To all who now with Him unite
    In ministry below.
 
 

## 695.  Speed on Thy Truth
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DS%2DzD0pJsbz4KjW0m4pJSmze9z8beRdq/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Speed on Thy truth, Eternal One,
    Thy holy law proclaim,
    Till ev'ry land beneath the sun,
    Has heard Jehovah's name.
    We own, O Lord, Thy sov'reign pow'r,
    And bow before Thy throne,
    To sing Thy glories in this hour,
    Immortal God alone.

    2.
    Thy truth shall stand, unchanging God,
    Long as the ages roll,
    Tho' trampled oft where sin has trod,
    And error chained the soul.
    Arise and shine, ye chosen band,
    Ye patient scattered few;
    No work so high, so deep, so grand,
    Has e'er been given you.

    3.
    We near that hour of calm surcease,
    From sorrow, death, and sin,
    That brings the weary one release,
    And ushers heaven in.
    Awake, arise, arise and shine;
    Proclaim His truth abroad;
    It is thy Saviour's work and thine,
    Thou messenger of God.

    4.
    We sing Thy praise, eternal Lord,
    Thy glorious truth proclaim;
    Thy mandate is a shield and sword,
    Thy word a living flame.
    Long as the promised years shall roll
    Long as eternity
    We'll bow to Thy benign control,
    And worship only Thee.
 
 

## 696.  Silent Messengers
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DbLmUrVpfIyBb73zrKfiLfT4zcRzRkUE/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Go forth on wings of faith and pray'r,
    Ye pages bright with love;
    Tho' mute, the joyful tidings bear,
    Salvation from above.

    Refrain:
    Silent messengers, go ye forth,
    From ocean to ocean, from South to North;
    Seed of the word, it shall not be sown in vain.

    2.
    Go, tell the sinful, careless soul,
    The warning God has giv'n;
    Go, make the wounded spirit whole,
    With healing balm from heav'n.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Go to the rude, the dark, the poor,
    That live estranged from God;
    Bid them the pearl of life secure,
    Bo't with a Saviour's blood.  [Refrain]

    4.
    O Jesus, friend of dying men,
    Thy presence we implore;
    Without thy blessing all is vain;
    Be with us evermore.  [Refrain]
 
 

## 697.  I Will Never Leave Thee
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2Dy3yFANykKd19XiBkvVsAcqLAqc4N17_/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I will never, never leave thee,
    I will never thee forsake;
    I will guide, and save, and keep thee,
    For my name and mercy's sake;
    Fear no evil, Fear no evil,
    Only all my counsel take.

    2.
    When the storm is raging round thee,
    Call on me in humble pray'r;
    I will fold my arms around me,
    Guard thee with the tend'rest care:
    In the trial, In the trial,
    I will make thy pathway clear.

    3.
    When the sky above is glowing,
    And around thee all is bright,
    Pleasure like a river flowing,
    All things tending to delight;
    I'll be with thee, I'll be with thee,
    I will guide thy steps aright.

    4.
    When thy soul is dark and clouded,
    Fill'd with doubt, and grief and care,
    Thro' the mists by which 'tis shrouded,
    I will make the light appear,
    And the banner, And the banner
    Of my love I will uprear.
 
 

## 698.  Speed Thy Servants
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2Dlaae25YeZXJts%2D%2DqdSoXdVuCZ2NEkC7/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Speed thy servants, Saviour, speed them;
    Thou art Lord of winds and waves:
    They were bound, but thou hast freed them;
    Now they go to free the slaves;
    Be thou with them, be thou with them;
    'Tis thine arm alone that saves.

    2.
    Friends and home and all forsaking,
    Lord, they go at thy command,
    As their stay thy promise taking,
    While they traverse sea and land
    O, be with them, O, be with them;
    Lead them safely by the hand.

    2.
    Where no fruit appears to cheer them,
    And they seem to toil in vain.
    Then in mercy, Lord, draw near them,
    Then their sinking hopes sustain;
    Thus supported, Thus supported
    Bid their zeal revive again.

    3.
    In the midst of opposition
    May they trust, O Lord in thee:
    When success attends their mission,
    May thy servants humble be;
    Never leave them, Never leave them,
    Till thy face in heav'n they see.
 
 

## 699.  In the vineyard of our Father
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DvhY2WioN9ZVfuesvDAB6irN3DDX2WW8/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    In the vineyard of our Father, 
    Daily work we find to do;
    Scatter'd gleanings we may gather,
    Though we are but young and few;
    Little clusters, Little clusters,
    Help to fill the garners too.

    2.
    Toiling early in the morning.
    Catching moments thro' the day,
    Nothing small or lowly scorning
    While we work, and watch, and pray
    Gath'ring gladly  Gath'ring gladly
    Free-will off'rings by the way.
 
 

## 700.  Pray for Reapers
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2Dmj2WQWMXrr1RqcYzehSucGQR2R_OLRH/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Saints of God, the dawn is bright'ning,
    Tokens of the coming Lord;
    O'er the earth the fields are whit'ning,
    Louder rings the Master's word:
    Pray for reapers, Pray for reapers,
    In the harvest of the Lord.

    2.
    Feebly now they toil in sadness,
    Weeping o'er the waste around,
    Slowly gath'ring grains of gladness,
    While their echoing cries resound:
    Pray that reapers, Pray that reapers,
    In God's harvest may abound.

    3.
    Now, O Lord, ful fill thy pleasure,
    Breathe upon thy chosen band,
    And with pentecostal measure,
    Send forth reapers in our land;
    Faithful reapers, Faithful reapers,
    Gath'ring sheaves for thy right hand.

    4.
    Soon shall end the time of weeping,
    Soon the reaping time will come,
    Heav'n and earth together keeping
    God's eternal harvest home;
    Saints and angels, Saints and angels,
    Shout the world's great harvest home.
 
 

## 701.  Anywhere With Jesus\_1
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrvtyTaoPsfTuOJ3hBpNoS_2Nv7toXEn/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Anywhere, dear Saviour,
    In thy vineyard wide,
    Where thou bidst me labor,
    Lord, there would I abide.
    Miracle of saving grace,
    That thou givest me a place
    Anywhere, dear Saviour, to work for thee.

    2.
    Where the night may find us,
    Surely matters not;
    If we camp with Jesus,
    O blessed is the spot!
    Quickly we the tent may fold,
    Cheerful march thro' storm or cold,
    Anywhere, dear Saviour, to work for thee.

    3.
    All along the journey,
    Let us fix our eyes
    On the "Rock of Ages,'
    Until we gain the prize,
    There the heart will make its home,
    Willing led by thee to roam,
    Anywhere, dear Saviour, to work for thee.
 
 

## 702.  The Lord Will Provide
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dm4Het5N5h1rEzTUqXZWKFVlLxuGLWYU/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    In some way or other the Lord will provide,
    It may not be my way,
    It may not be thy way,
    And yet in his own way, "the Lord will provide."

    2.
    At some time or other the Lord will provide;
    It may not be my time,
    It may not be thy time,
    And yet in his own time, "The Lord will provide."

    3.
    Despond then no longer, the Lord will provide;
    And this be the token
    No word he hath spoken
    Was ever yet broken, "the Lord will provide."

    4.
    March on, then, right boldly; the sea shall divide;
    The path shall be glorious;
    With shoutings victorious
    We'll join in the chorus, "the Lord will provide."
 
 

## 703.  'Speed Away!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1De6qu_gL5dangigLpBtPb1jSwYyQ75rw/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Speed away!  speed away, over mountain and sea,
    To the hearts that are waiting with welcome for thee;
    There are eyes that will gleam with the glad gospel light,
    There are feet that will walk in the pathway of right,
    There are voices to sing  
    Praise to Jesus the King:
    Speed away!  speed away!  Speed away!

    2.
    Speed away!  speed away from thy home fair and bright,
    To the homes that are darken'd by sin's starless night,
    Tho' the world with its pleasures invite thee to stay,
    Tho' the lov'd ones entreat thee "good-bye" to delay
    Look away thro' the tears,
    To eternity's years:
    Speed away!  speed away!  Speed away!

    3.
    Speed away!  speed away, with the love of thy Lord,
    With the glorious tidings revealed in his word:
    Bear the Bethlehem story with gladness to men,
    Bid the world to prepare for His coming again;
    Free salvation proclaim 
    Thro' Immanuel's name:  
    Speed away!  speed away!  Speed away!
 
 

## 704.  'Can You Wait?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dd0uQjqS8oxiKIixh_WSX85EEiQnXkOg/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Could you wait, could you wait if a brother were lost
    In the dark, stormy night, and a flood to be cross'd?
    If you knew how to guide him from danger and death,
    Would you sit idly singing sweet carols of faith?
    O, the faith born above
    Is the faith full of love!
    Could you wait?  Could you wait?  Could you wait?

    2.
    Could you wait, could you wait if a sister should cry, 
    "I am wall'd in by fire!  I'm not ready to die!"
    If her cottage or palace were circled with flame,
    And you heard her voice calling you, calling by name,
    Would you linger to read
    Of some beautiful deed?
    Could you wait?  Could you wait?  Could you wait?

    3.
    In the flood, in the flood and the tempest-torn night,
    There are brothers now wand'ring who long for the right;
    There are sisters as gentle as ever were known,
    Whom the fires of perdition surround as their own:
    They are yielding their blood
    To the flame and the flood,
    Can you wait?  Can you wait?  Can you wait?
 
 

## 705.  'What of the Night?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dpzx0k3SoXS361scF0ADm1rynZz1EF6K/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Watchman on the walls of Zion,
    What, O tell us, of the night?
    Is the day star now arising?
    Will the morn soon greet our night?
    O'er your vision
    Shine there now some rays of light?
    O'er your vision
    Shine there now some rays of light?

    2.
    Tell, O tell us, are the landmarks
    On our voyage all passed by?
    Are we nearing now the haven?
    Can we e'en the land descry?
    Do we truly
    See the heav'nly kingdom nigh?
    Do we truly
    See the heav'nly kingdom nigh?

    3.
    Light is beaming, day is coming!
    Let us sound aloud the cry;
    We behold the day star rising,
    Pure and bright in yonder sky!
    Saints, be joyful;
    Your redemption draweth nigh.
    Saints, be joyful;
    Your redemption draweth nigh.

    4.
    We have found the chart and compass,
    And are sure the land is near;
    Onward, onward we are hasting,
    Soon the haven will appear;
    Let your voices
    Sound aloud your holy cheer.
    Let your voices
    Sound aloud your holy cheer.
 
 

## 706.  'Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DnvEO18Y1wKzI%2DS_pDTEgDSoJ7OntU3F/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah!
    Pilgrim through this barren land:
    I am weak, but thou art mighty;
    Hold me with thy pow'rful hand:
    Bread of heaven,
    Feed me till I want no more.

    2.
    Open now the crystal fountain,
    Whence the healing waters flow;
    Let the fiery, cloudy pillar,
    Lead me all my journey through:
    Strong Deliv'rer,
    Be thou still my strength and shield.

    3.
    When I tread the verge of Jordan,
    Bid my anxious fears subside:
    Bear me through the swelling current,
    Land me safe on Canaan's side;
    Songs of praises
    I will ever give to thee.
 
 

## 707.  Zion stands with walls surrounded
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DtYMkBjwG67TuKz%2DnNT5d7i9YADR%2Df6e/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Zion stand with walls surrounded,
    Zion, kept by pow'r divine:
    All her foes shall be comfounded,
    Though the world in arms combine:
    Happy Zion,
    What a favored lot is thine!

    2.
    Ev'ry human tie may perish;
    Friend to friend unfaithful prove;
    Mothers cease their own to cherish;
    Heav'n and earth at last remove:
    But no changes
    Can attend Jehovah's love.

    3.
    In the furnace God may prove thee,
    Thence to bring thee forth more bright;
    But can never cease to love thee:
    Thou art precious in his sight:
    God is with thee,
    God, thine everlasting light.
 
 

## 708.  'Lo! He comes, with clouds descending'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DoKLLf7tBtk%2DypRDxOMMX5i8MmSHOB5Q/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Lo!  He comes, with clouds descending,
    Once for favor'd sinners slain;
    Countless angels, him attending,
    Swell the triumph of his train:
    Hallelujah!
    Jesus comes and comes to reign.

    2.
    Ev'ry eye shall now behold him
    Robed in dreadful majesty!
    Those who set at naught and sold him,
    Pierced, and nailed him to the tree,
    Deeply wailing,
    Shall the true Messiah see.

    3.
    Yea, amen!  let all adore thee,
    High on thy eternal throne!
    Saviour, take the power and glory,
    Make thy righteous sentence known:
    O come quickly,
    Claim the kingdom for thine own.
 
 

## 709.  In the Hour of Trial
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dc9HPScfsWsl5V9FrDqMVHF_UieSOwvI/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    In the hour of trial,
    Father, strengthen me;
    Lest by base denial,
    I depart from thee.
    When thou see'st me waver,
    With a touch recall,
    Nor from thy dear favor,
    Suffer me to fall.

    2.
    With forbidden pleasures
    Would this vain world charm,
    Or its sordid treasures 
    Spread to work me harm;
    By thy love sustaining,
    Father keep thy child;
    All my foes restraining,
    And my passions wild.

    3.
    Should thy mercy send me
    Sorrow, care, and woe;
    Or should pain attend me
    On my path below:
    Grant that I may never
    Fail thy hand to see;
    Grant that I may ever
    Cast my care on thee.  Amen.
 
 

## 710.  As Pants the Hart
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dor%2DY20jmzEEI7D8tJ608mOozqPgKT7o/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    As pants the wearied hart for cooling springs,
    That sinks exhausted in the summer's chase,
    So pants my soul for thee, great King of kings,
    So thirsts to reach thy sacred dwelling place.

    2.
    Lord, thy sure mercies, ever in my sight,
    My heart shall gladden thro' the tedious day;
    And 'midst the dark and gloomy shades of night,
    To thee, my God, I'll tune the grateful lay.

    3.
    Why faint my soul?  why doubt Jehovah's aid?
    Thy God the God of mercy still shall prove;
    Within his courts thy thanks shall yet be paid;
    Unquestioned be his faithfulness and love.
 
 

## 711.  Revive Thy Work
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ed6gMS5DlS3rOpe6KXX17XUysif0LF9F/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Revive Thy work, O Lord, Thy mighty arm make bare;
    Speak with the voice that wakes the dead, and make Thy people hear.

    2.
    Revive Thy work, O Lord, disturb this sleep of death;
    Quicken the smould'ring embers now by Thine almighty breath.

    3.
    Revive Thy work, O Lord, create soul-thirst for Thee;
    And hung'ring for the bread of life, oh, may our spirits be.

    4.
    Revive Thy work, O Lord, exalt Thy precious name;
    And by the Holy Ghost our love for Thee and Thine inflame.
 
 

## 712.  By Faith Alone
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EZ5JtTFABbPKIwVJ77ZZobFfFnlnEZm1/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    If, through unruffled seas,
    Calmly to'ard heav'n we sail,
    With grateful hearts, O God, to thee,
    We'll own the fav'ring gale.
    With grateful hearts, O God, to thee,
    We'll own the fav'ring gale.

    2.
    But should the surges rise,
    And rest delay to come,
    Blest be the sorrow, kind the storm,
    Which drives us nearer home.
    Blest be the sorrow, kind the storm,
    Which drives us nearer home.

    3.
    Soon shall our doubts and fears
    All yield to thy control;
    Thy tender mercies shall illume
    The midnight of the soul.
    Thy tender mercies shall illume
    The midnight of the soul.

    4.
    Teach us in ev'ry state,
    To make thy will our own,
    And when the joys of sense depart,
    To live by faith alone.
    And when the joys of sense depart,
    To live by faith alone.

    1.
    "My times are in thy hand:"
    My God, I wish them there;
    My life, my friends, my all I leave
    Entirely to thy care.

    2.
    "My times are in thy hand:"
    Why should I doubt or fear?
    My Father's hand will never cause
    His child a needless tear.

    3.
    "My times are in thy hand;"
    I'll always trust in thee,
    Till I possess the promised land,
    And all thy glory see.

    1.
    Ye servants of the Lord,
    Each in his office wait;
    Observant of his heavn'ly word,
    And watchful at his gate.
    Observant of his heav'nly word,
    And watchful at his gate.

    1.
    Sow in the morn thy seed;
    At eve hold not thy hand;
    To doubt and fear give thou no heed;
    Broadcast it o'er the land.

    2.
    Thou canst not toil in vain;
    Cold, heat, and moist, and dry,
    Shall foster and mature the grain
    For garners in the sky.

    3.
    Then, when the glorious end,
    The day of God, shall come,
    The angel reapers shall descend,
    And heav'n shout "Harvest home!"
 
 

## 716.  'How Long?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EEMlbw1o6vLgCd%2DgrRBwz4TwsfXetZhG/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How long, O Lord our Saviour,
    Wilt thou remain away?
    Our hearts are growing weary
    Of thy so long delay.
    O when shall come the moment,
    When, brighter far than morn,
    The sunshine of thy glory
    Shall on thy people dawn?

    2.
    How long, O gracious Master,
    Wilt thou thy household leave?
    So long hast thou now tarried,
    Few thy return believe.
    Immersed in sloth and folly,
    Thy servants, Lord, we see;
    And few of us stand ready
    With joy to welcome thee.

    3.
    O, wake thy slumb'ring people;
    Send forth the solemn cry;
    Let all the saints repeat it,
    "The Saviour draweth nigh!"
    May all our lamps be burning,
    Our loins well girded be,
    Each longing heart preparing
    With joy thy face to see.
 
 

## 717.  Speak often to each other
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EYyB6WShuTf3XhD3kIazLFX9EkLqltoO/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Speak often to each other,
    To cheer the fainting mind;
    And often be your voices
    In pure devotion joined;
    Though trials may await you,
    The crown before you lies;
    Take courage, brother pilgrim,
    And soon you'll win the prize.

    2.
    Ye shall be mine, says Jesus,
    In that auspicious day
    When I make up my jewels,
    Released from cumb'rous clay;
    He'll polish and refine you
    From worthless dross and sin,
    And to his heavenly kingdom
    Will bid you enter in.

    3.
    We'll range the wide dominion
    Of our Redeemer round,
    And in dissolving raptures
    Be lost in love profound;
    While all the flaming harpers
    Begin the lasting song,
    With hallelujahs rolling
    From the unnumbered throng.
 
 

## 718.  The world is very evil
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E0Hob7BPwwY0mud89Q_ca%2Dz3DxxKLaJy/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The world is very evil,
    The times are waxing late;
    Be sober and keep vigil;
    The Judge is at the gate,
    The Judge who comes in mercy,
    The Judge who comes with might,
    Who comes to end the evil,
    Who comes to crown the right.

    2.
    Arise, arise, O Christian,
    Let right to wrong succeed;
    Let penitential sorrow
    To heavenly gladness lead,
    To light that has no evening,
    That knows no moon nor sea,
    The light so fair and golden,
    Of Christ, the sinless One.

    3.
    Behold, the morn shall waken,
    And shadows shall decay,
    And each true-hearted servant
    Shall shine as does the day;
    And God, our King and Portion,
    In fulnesss of his grace,
    Shall we behold forever,
    And worship face to face.
 
 

## 719.  The morning light is breaking
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EMTkY4KPKU2MTbkp2mhyA0gbRNs08Xnf/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The morning light is breaking,
    The darkness disappears,
    The sons of earth are waking
    To penitential tears;
    Each breeze that sweeps the ocean
    Brings tidings from afar,
    Of nations in commotion,
    Prepared for Zion's war.

    2.
    Rich dew of grace come o'er us,
    In many a gentle show'r,
    And harvest fields before us
    Are op'ning ev'ry hour;
    Each cry to heaven going,
    Abundant answer brings,
    And heav'nly gales are blowing,
    With peace upon their wings.

    3.
    Blest river of salvation,
    Pursue thy onward way;
    Flow thou to ev'ry nation, 
    Nor in thy richness stay.
    Stay not till all the lowly
    Triumphant reach their home;
    Stay not till all the holy
    Proclaim, "The Lord is come."
 
 

## 720.  The Night Is Coming
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dwp%2Drt7RGiAYH4U_47JkayuIY9rUGI34/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Work, for the night is coming,
    Work thro' the morning hours;
    Work while the dew is sparkling,
    Work 'mid springing flow'rs.
    Work when the day grows brighter,
    Work in the glowing sun;
    Work, for the night is coming,
    When man's work is done.

    2.
    Work, for the night is coming,
    Work thro' the sunny noon;
    Fill brightest hours with labor;
    Rest comes sure and seen.
    Give ev'ry flying minute
    Something to keep in store;
    Work, for the night is coming,
    When man works no more.

    3.
    Work, for the night is coming
    Under the sunset skies;
    While their bright tints are glowing
    Work, for daylight flies.
    Work till the last beam fadeth,
    Fadeth to shine no more;
    Work while the night is dark'ning,
    When man's work is o'er.
 
 

## 721.  No Work Too Humble
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19y1BTNbW6KSUoDHZK_VBP%2Dzfpeol0DG5/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There is no work too humble
    For Christian hands to do;
    There is no path too lowly
    For our feet to pursue;
    Our blessed Lord and Master
    Was servant unto all;
    None were to poor and needy
    For him to heed their call.

    2.
    If we are his disciples,
    Call'd by his holy name,
    A portion of his Spirit
    We surely ought to claim.
    And tho' the task be menial
    Which he for us hath set;
    His own divine example
    We never should forget.

    3.
    That he, the High and Holy,
    Whose life-work was complete,
    Should gird himself for labor,
    And washed those humble feet!
    And yet we shrink from duties
    Which seem so far above
    This deed of Christ-like meekness,
    This tender proof of love!
 
 

## 722.  Carry the Joyful Tidings
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19mMhyjdWVPI1z_ChT0swIhQdIn1t%2DuhA/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Carry the joyful tidings
    To every land and sea;
    Banish the heart dividings,
    Brothers should brothers be;
    Christ died for all the nations,
    "One flesh and blood," saith he;
    There are no tribes or stations;
    One in the Lord are we.

    2.
    God who hath lent his talents,
    Bids us his service choose;
    God who hath lent his riches,
    Bids us in kindness use;
    God who hath freedom given,
    Calls us to make it known;
    He is preparing heaven
    Not for ourselves alone.

    3.
    Souls on the Orient mountains,
    Souls in the Northern snows,
    Souls by the Southern fountains
    Souls where the sunset glows;
    Souls out of Christ the Saviour;
    O for a Church of love,
    Bearing the priceless favor,
    Pointing the lost above!
 
 

## 723.  'O For a Faith!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19uuuoBN6QtR5N49X_tNlbRzt43fkUxwK/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O for a faith that will not shrink,
    Tho' press'd by many a foe;
    That will not tremble on the brink
    Of poverty or woe;

    2.
    That will not murmur or complain
    Beneath the chast'ning rod,
    But in the hour of grief or pain
    Can lean upon its God.

    3.
    A faith that shines more bright and clear
    When tempests rage without;
    Then when in danger knows no fear,
    In darkness feels no doubt;

    4.
    That bears unmoved the world's dread frown,
    Nor heeds its scornful smile;
    That sin's wild ocean cannot drown,
    Nor its soft arts beguile.

    5.
    Lord, give me such a faith as this,
    And then, whate'er may come,
    I'll taste e'en here the hallowed bliss
    Of an eternal home.
 
 

## 724.  'How Cheering!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ded8xpHi2QWLM177djr2KkBlhTIaUyO/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How cheering is the Christian's hope,
    While toiling here below!
    It buoys us up while passing thro'
    This wilderness of woe,

    2.
    It points to us a land of rest,
    Where saints with Christ will reign,
    Where we shall meet the loved of earth,
    And never part again,

    3.
    A land where sin can never come,
    Temptations ne'er annoy,
    Where happiness will ever dwell,
    And that without alloy.

    4.
    In that bright world no fears will flow,
    Death ne'er can enter there;
    For all who gain that heavenly land
    Will be as angels are.

    5.
    Fly, ling'ring moments, fly, O fly,
    Dear Saviour, quickly come!
    We long to see thee as thou art,
    And reach that blissful home.
 
 

## 725.  Our Help in Ages Past
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19yiCjf9SVmOsFX1%2DsuU%2DOx_GKQUbw2zr/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O God our help in ages past,
    Our hope for years to come;
    Our shelter from the stormy blast,
    And our eternal home!

    2.
    Under the shadow of Thy throne
    Thy saints have dwelt secure;
    Sufficient in thine arm alone,
    And our defence is sure.

    3.
    Before the hills in order stood,
    Or earth received her frame,
    From everlasting Thou art God,
    To endless years the same.

    4.
    A thousand ages, in Thy sight, 
    Are like an ev'ning gone;
    Short as the watch that ends the night,
    Before the rising sun.
 
 

## 726.  Mysterious Way
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ShPrVUhZWbfC1J3iUUbLmcN2mqhViIY/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God moves in a mysterious way
    His wonders to perform:
    He plants His footsteps in the sea,
    And rides upon the storm.

    2.
    Deep in unfathomable mines
    Of never-feeling skill,
    He treasures up His bright designs,
    And works His sovereign will.

    3.
    Ye faithful saints, fresh courage take!
    The clouds ye so much dread,
    Are big with mercy, and will break
    In blessings on your head.

    4.
    Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
    But trust Him for His grace;
    Behind a frowning providence
    He hides a smiling face.

    5.
    Blind unbelief is sure to err,
    And scan His work in vain;
    God is His own interpreter,
    And He will make it plain.
 
 

## 727.  The Living Church
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19lNLwfpDTzRA5gJeh67BNGUZ4HGM0I63/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Oh, where are kings and empires now,
    Of old that went and came?
    But, Lord, Thy Church is living yet,
    Thro' ages still the same.

    2.
    We mark her goodly battlements,
    And her foundations strong;
    We hear within the solemn voice
    Of her unending song.

    3.
    For not like kingdoms of the world
    Thy holy church, O God!
    They change with changing words of men;
    She rests upon Thy word.

    4.
    Unshaken as eternal hills,
    When on Thy truth she stands,
    A mountain that shall fill the earth,
    A house not made by hands.
 
 

## 728.  We Bless Thee For Thy Peace
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19v40GONBdCjxB7MVf5G51WmH5XNo63BG/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    We bless Thee for Thy peace, O God,
    Deep as th' unfathomed sea,
    Which falls like sunshine on the road
    Of those who trust in Thee.

    2.
    We ask not, Father, for repose
    Which comes from outward rest,
    If we may have thro' all life's woes
    Thy peace within our breast,

    3.
    That peace which suffers and is strong
    Trusts where it cannot see,
    Deems not the trial way too long,
    But leaves the end with Thee.

    4.
    That peace which flows serene and deep
    A river in the soul
    Whose banks a living verdure keep,
    God's sunshine o'er the whole.

    5.
    O Father, give our hearts this peace,
    Whate'er the outward be,
    Till all life's discipline shall cease,
    And we go home to Thee.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19gx7q3wNi3t39qm_96JlrXogiaxUfCAp/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Saviour, like a shepherd lead us;
    Much we need thy tender care;
    In thy pleasant pastures feed us,
    For our use thy fold prepare;
    Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
    Thou hast bought us, thine we are;
    Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
    Thou hast bought us, thine we are.

    2.
    We are thine, do thou befriend us,
    Be the Guardian of our way;
    Keep thy flock, from sin defend us,
    Seek us when we go astray,
    Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
    Hear, O hear us, when we pray;
    Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
    Hear, O hear us, when we pray.

    3.
    Thou hast promised to receive us,
    Poor and sinful tho' we be;
    Thou hast mercy to relieve us,
    Grace to cleanse, and pow'r to free.
    Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
    We will early turn to thee;
    Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
    We will early turn to thee.
 
 

## 730.  'God has said, Forever blessed'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19qkbBC4j4bSsOqtKSJNXvf%2DjMRH92UCn/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God has said, "Forever blessed
    Those who seek me in their youth;
    Thy shall find the path of wisdom,
    And the narrow way of truth."
    Guide us, Saviour,
    Guide us, Saviour,
    In the narrow way of truth.

    2.
    Be our strength, for we are weakness;
    Be our wisdom and our guide;
    May we walk in love and meekness,
    Nearer to our Saviour's side:
    Naught can harm us;
    Naught can harm us;
    While we thus in thee abide.
 
 

## 731.  Always With Us
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BFyHhRZ8s7E6N3J1LasjeRovzbbQmXgF/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Always with us, always with us,
    Words of cheer and words of love;
    Thus the risen Saviour whispers,
    From his dwelling place above.
    With us when we toil in sadness,
    Sowing much and reaping none;
    Telling us that in the future, 
    Golden harvest shall be won.

    2.
    With us when the storm is sweeping
    O'er our pathway dark and drear;
    Waking hope within our bosoms,
    Stilling ev'ry anxious fear.
    With us in the lonely valley,
    When we cross the chilling stream;
    Lighting up the gloomy shadows
    With salvation's radiant beam.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B2r29n_SGrGXb7tJfJmYhnTDKPAr0DRe/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Meek and lowly, pure and holy.
    Chief among the blessed three.
    Turning sadness into gladness,
    Heav'n born art thou, charity!
    Pity dwelleth in thy bosom.
    Kindness reigneth o'er thy heart;
    Gentle thoughts alone can sway thee
    Judgment hath in thee no part.

    2.
    Hoping ever, failing never.
    Though deceived, believing still;
    Long abiding, all confiding
    To thy heav'nly Father's will;
    Never weary of well-doing.
    Never fearful of the end;
    Claiming all mankind as brothers,
    Thou dost all alike befriend.

    1.
    Tossed upon life's raging billow.
    Sweet it is, O Lord, to know
    Thou didst press a sailor's pillow.
    Thou canst feel a sailor's woe;
    Never slumb'ring, never sleeping.
    Tho' the night be dark and drear,
    Thou the faithful watch art keeping;
    "All is well," thy constant cheer.

    2.
    Thou my heart the hope will cherish,
    While to thee I lift mine eye,
    Thou wilt save me o'er I perish,
    Thou wilt hear the sailor's cry;
    And the mast and sail be riven,
    Soon life's voyage will be o'er;
    Safely moored in heav'n's wide haven,
    Storm and temptest vex no more.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AxFbdMbc4WnZ9DG1HTpWROShq8xROvpk/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Watchman, tell me, does the morning
    Of fair Zion's glory dawn?
    Have the signs that marks His coming
    Yet upon thy pathway shone?
    Pilgrim, yes!  arise, look round thee;
    Light is breaking in the skies;
    Gird thy bridal robes around thee,
    Morning dawns, arise!  arise!

    2.
    Watchman, see, the light is beaming
    Brighter still upon thy way,
    Signs thro' all the earth are gleaming,
    Omens of the coming day
    When the Jubal trumpet, sounding,
    Shall awake from land and sea
    All the saints of God, now sleeping,
    Clad in immortality.

    3.
    Watchman, hail the light ascending
    Of the grand Sabbatic year;
    All with voices loud proclaiming
    That the kingdom now is near:
    Pilgrim, yes, I see just yonder,
    Canaan's glorious hights arise;
    Salem, too, appears in grandeur,
    Tow'ring 'neath its sunlit skies.

    4.
    Watchman, in the golden city,
    Seated on his jasper throne,
    Zion's King, arrayed in beauty,
    Reigns in peace from zone to zone.
    There on sunlit hills and mountains,
    Golden beams serenely glow;
    Purling streams and crystal fountains,
    On whose banks sweet flow'rets blow.

    5.
    Watchman, see, the land is nearing,
    With its vernal fruits and flow'rs;
    On, just yonder, O how cheering!
    Bloom forever Eden's bow'rs.
    Hark!  the choral strains are ringing.
    Wafted on the balmy air;
    See the millions, hear them singing,
    Soon the pilgrim will be there.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B4GzKSwjXUKXU_eDJRxakz_xq37D5L5c/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Gracious Father, guard thy children
    From the foe's destructive pow'r;
    Save O save them, Lord, from falling
    In this dark and trying hour.
    Thou wilt surely prove thy people,
    All our graces must be tried; 
    But thy word illumes our pathway,
    And in God we still confide.

    2.
     We are in the time of waiting;
    Soon we shall behold our Lord,
    Wafted far away from sorrow,
    To receive our rich reward.
    Keep us, Lord, till thine appearing,
    Pure, unspotted from the world;
    Let thy Holy Spirit cheer us
    Till thy banner is unfurled.

    1.
    Long upon the mountains, weary.
    Have the scattered flock been torn;
    Dark the desert paths, and dreary;
    Grievous trials have they borne.
    Now the gath'ring call is sounding,
    Solemn in its warning voice;
    Union, faith, and love, abounding,
    Bid the little flock rejoice.

    2.
    Now the light of truth they're seeking.
    In its onward track pursue;
    All the ten commandments keeping,
    They are holy, just, and true.
    On the words of life they're feeding,
    Precious to their taste, so sweet;
    All their Master's precepts heeding,
    Bowing humbly at his feet.

    3.
    Soon He comes, with clouds descending;
    All his saints, entombed, arise;
    The redeemed, in anthems blending,
    Shout their vict'ry thro' the skies.
    O, we long for thine appearing!
    Come, O Saviour, quickly come!
    Blessed hope!  our spirits cheering,
    Take thy ransomed children home.

    1.
    Mid scenes of confusion and creature complaints,
    How sweet to my soul is communion of saints;
    To find at the banquet of mercy there's room,
    And feel in the presence of Jesus at home.
    Home, home, sweet, 
    Prepare me, dear Saviour, for heaven my home.

    2.
    Sweet bonds that unite all the children of peace,
    And thrice precious Jesus, whose love can not cease!
    Tho' oft from thy presence in sadness I roam,
    By faith I behold thee in glory at home.
    Home, home, sweet,
    Prepare me, dear Saviour, for heaven my home.

    3.
    While where in this valley of conflict I stay,
    O give me submission, and strength as my day;
    In all my afflictions to thee would I come,
    Rejoicing in hope of my glorious home.
    Home, home, sweet,
    Prepare me, dear Saviour, for heaven my home.

    1.
    Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam.
    Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home!
    A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,
    Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.

    Refrain:
    Home, home, sweet, sweet home;
    Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.

    2.
    An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain,
    O give me my lowly thatched cottage again;
    The birds singing gaily, that came at my call,
    And with them, God's peace, which is dearer than all.  [Refrain]

    Kind words can never die,
    Cherish'd and blest;
    God knows how deep they lie,
    Stored in the breast,
    Like childhood's simple rhymes,
    Said o'er a thousand times,
    Yes, in all years and climes,
    Distant or near.

    Refrain:
    Kind words can never die,
    Never die, never die;
    Kind words can never die,
    No, never die.

    2.
    Sweet thot's can never die,
    Tho' like the flow'rs
    Their brightest hues may fly
    In wint'ry hours;
    But when the gentle dew
    Gives them their charms anew,
    With many an added hue
    They bloom again.

    Refrain:
    Sweet words can never die,
    Never die, never die;
    Sweet tho'ts can never die,
    No, never die.

    3.
    True love can never die,
    Tho' in the tomb
    We all may silent lie,
    Wrapp'd in its gloom;
    Tho' mortal flesh decay,
    There comes a glorious day,
    When dust shall soar away
    To Christ above.

    Refrain:
    True love can never die,
    Never die, never die;
    True love can never die,
    No, never die.
 
 

## 740.  Homeward Bound
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A4cjLMpFD1sotU8e7u8S4JMEkOY0fiz0/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Out on an ocean all boundless we ride,
    We're homeward bound, homeward bound;
    Tossed on the waves of a rough, restless tide,
    We're homeward bound, etc.
    Far from the safe, quiet harbor we've rode,
    Seeking our Father's celestial abode,
    Promise of which on us each is bestowed,
    We're homeward bound, homeward etc.

    2.
    Wildly the storm sweeps us on as it roars,
    We're homeward bound, etc.
    Look!  yonder lie the bright heavenly shores,
    We're homeward bound, etc.
    Steady, O pilot!  stand firm at the wheel;
    Steady, we soon shall outweather the gale;
    O, how we fly 'neath the loud-creaking sail!
    We're homeward bound, etc.

    3.
    Into the harbor of heaven now we glide,
    We're home at last, home at last;
    Softly we drift on its bright silver tide,
    We're home at last, home at last.
    Glory to God!  all our dangers are o'er,
    We stand secure on the glorified shore;
    Glory to God!  we shall shout ever more;
    We're home at last, home at last.
 
 

## 741.  Sweet Hour of Prayer
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/194LiVzfGJb3LLOl6NJ2yQZ%2DPO7k%2DY8JV/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Sweet hour of pray'r, sweet hour of pray'r,
    That calls me from a world of care,
    And bids me, at my Father's throne
    Make all my wants and wishes known!
    In seasons of distress and grief,
    My soul has often found relief,
    And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
    By thy return, sweet hour of pray'r.

    2.
    Sweet hour of prayer!  sweet hour of prayer!
    Thy wings shall my petition bear
    To Him whose truth and faithfulness
    Engage the waiting soul to bless.
    And since he bids me seek his face,
    Believe his word, and trust his grace,
    I'll cast on him my ev'ry care,
    And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

    3.
    Sweet hour of prayer!  sweet hour of prayer!
    May I thy consolation share
    Till from Mount Pisgah's lofty height
    I view my home, and take my flight.
    In my immortal flesh I'll rise
    To seize the everlasting prize,
    And shout while passing thro' the air,
    "Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!" 
 
 

## 742.  Gliding Swiftly By
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18pA8Z0WSnILAVAu6zvvtHaq_CJSYqRmE/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    My days are gliding swiftly by,
    And I, a pilgrim stranger,
    Would not detain them as they fly
    These hours of toil and danger;

    Chorus:
    For O, we stand on Jordan's strand,
    And soon we'll all pass over;
    And just before, the shining shore,
    We may almost discover.

    2.
    We'll gird our loins, my brethren dear,
    Our distant home discerning;
    Our absent Lord has left us word,
    Let ev'ry lamp be burning.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Should coming days be cold and dark,
    We need not cease our singing;
    That perfect rest naught can molest,
    Where golden harps are ringing.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Let sorrow's rudest tempests blow,
    Each cord on earth to sever,
    Our King says, Come, and there's our home, 
    Forever, O, forever!  [Chorus]
 
 

## 743.  Blessed Hope
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19LtKTvfBZcF6HIxXToVQU6kIFKcAPD13/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There is a blessed hope,
    More precious and more bright
    Than all the joyless mockery
    The world esteems delight.

    2.
    There is a lovely star
    That lights the darkest gloom,
    And sheds a peaceful radiance o'er
    The prospects of the tomb.

    3.
    There is a cheering voice
    That lifts the soul above,
    Dispels the painful, anxious doubt,
    And whispers, "God is love."

    4.
    That voice from Calv'ry's height
    Proclaims the soul forgiv'n;
    That star is revelation's light,
    That hope, the hope of heav'n.
 
 

## 744.  Thus Far
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Ba8GNGbmBoDIOhcshyGTbhHFDg2RQ2K/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Thus far the Lord has led me on;
    Thus far his pow'r prolongs my days;
    And ev'ry evening shall make known
    Some fresh memorial of his grace.

    2.
    Much of my time has run to waste,
    And I, perhaps, am near my home;
    But he forgives my follies past,
    And gives me strength for days to come.

    3.
    I lay my body down to sleep;
    Peace is the pillow for my head;
    While well-appointed angels keep
    Their watchful stations round my bed.
 
 

## 745.  On Thy Care
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18p8K%2DqZBuGb%2DOMF0jLjTOnLJ4n3tAxm0/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    My spirit on thy care,
    Blest Saviour, I recline;
    Thou wilt not leave me to despair,
    For thou art love divine.

    2.
    In thee I place my trust,
    On thee I calmly rest;
    I know thee good, I know thee just,
    And count thy choice the best.

    3.
    Whate'er events betide,
    Thy will they all perform;
    Safe in thy breast my head I hide,
    Nor fear the coming storm.

    4.
    Let good or ill befall,
    It must be good for me,
    Secure of having thee in all,
    Of having all in thee.
 
 

## 746.  Not Less to Bear
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18zslQ5oXJMNeeUBvlR6inb706RWr%2DK7g/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I ask not, Lord, for less to bear
    Here in the narrow way,
    But that I may thy blessing share
    In all I do or say,
    In all I do or say.

    2.
    With thee to lead, I will not fear
    In scenes with danger rife,
    While still thy cheering voice I hear,
    "I am the Way, the Life,
    I am the Way, the Life."

    3.
    Then help me to improve with care,
    These precious moments giv'n;
    For they a faithful record bear,
    Of good or ill, to Heav'n,
    Of good or ill, to Heav'n.
 
 

## 747.  Children of the King
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rBQm7grclQ3iRKK8KKMk8d%2DKmsw68y2/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Children of the heav'nly King
    As we journey, sweetly sing;
    Sing your Saviour's worthy praise,
    Glorious in his works and ways.

    2.
    We are trav'ling home to God,
    In the way the fathers trod;
    And when Christ our Lord shall come,
    We shall all be gathered home.

    3.
    Shout, ye little flock, and blest,
    You near Jesus' throne shall rest;
    There your seats are now prepared,
    There your kingdom and reward.

    4.
    Fear not, brethren, joyful stand
    On the borders of your land;
    Jesus Christ, your Father's Son,
    Bids you undismayed go on.
 
 

## 748.  Scorn Praise of Men
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18XRF8Imxitcj8jzZ9J0_ZQSzMmf0IUuw/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O blest is he who can divine
    Where truth and justice lie,
    And dares to take the side that seems
    Wrong to man's blinded eye.

    2.
    Then learn to scorn the praise of men,
    And learn to lose with God;
    For Jesus won the world thro' shame,
    And beckons thee his road.

    3.
    For right is right, since God is God,
    And right the day must win;
    To doubt would be disloyalty,
    To falter would be sin.
 
 

## 749.  Sweet the Time
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18edn6uilmYxM%2D35ru_xpPDcZpKm99xOA/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Sweet the time, exceeding sweet!
    When the saints together meet
    When the Saviour is the theme,
    When they join to sing of him.

    2.
    Sing we then eternal love,
    Such as did the Father move
    He beheld the world undone,
    Loved the world the gave his Son.

    3.
    Sing the Son's amazing love;
    How he left the realms above,
    Took our nature and our place,
    Lived and died to save our race.

    4.
    Sweet the time, exceeding sweet,
    When the saints in heav'n shall meet
    Jesus still will be the theme,
    They shall always sing of him.
 
 

## 750.  Mourn for the Slain
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rRucdkbSOhJA5l19yaRZKV6c0PhRfTH/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Mourn for the thousands slain,
    The youthful and the strong,
    Mourn for the wine-cup's fearful reign,
    And the deluded throng.

    2.
    Mourn for the lost, but call,
    Call to the strong, the free;
    Rouse them to shun that dreadful fall,
    And to the Refuge flee.

    3.
    Mourn for the lost, but pray,
    Pray to our God above,
    To break the fell destroyer's sway.
    And show his saving love.
 
 

## 751.  'Ye Christian Heralds!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bl6e5dYxZ8FerlGWs3NZ8si5GSIxGfwu/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Ye Christian heralds!  go, proclaim
    Salvation thro' Immanuel's name;
    To distant climes the tidings bear,
    And plant the Rose of Sharon there.

    2.
    He'll shield you with a wall of fire,
    With flaming zeal your breast inspire,
    Bid raging winds their fury cease,
    And hush the tempest into peace.

    3.
    And when our labors all are o'er,
    Then we shall meet to part no more,
    There with the blood-bought throng to fall
    And crown our Jesus Lord of all.
 
 

## 752.  'Soldiers of Christ, Arise!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BrZ6i4ggKMZhZgTkp91smrdnwrn5glNo/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Soldiers of Christ, arise,
    And put your armor on;
    Fight, for the battle will be ours;
    We fight to win a crown.

    2.
    We fight not against flesh,
    We wrestle not with blood;
    But principalities and pow'rs,
    And for the truth of God;

    3.
    With wicked spirits, too,
    That in high places stand,
    Perverting oft the word of God,
    And say 'tis by command.
 
 

## 753.  Help in God for Thee
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bqhb7a9wBdt3Znul8J2KdvUmag6b2RZY/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The tempter to my soul hath said, 
    "There is no help in God for thee;"
    Lord, lift thou up thy servant's head;
    My glory, shield, and solace be.

    2.
    Thus to the Lord I raised my cry;
    He heard me from his holy hill;
    At his command the waves rolled by;
    He beckoned, and the winds were still.

    3.
    I will not fear, tho' armed throngs
    Compass my steps in all their wrath;
    Salvation to the Lord belongs;
    His presence guards his people's path.
 
 

## 754.  Imposture Shrinks
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BeDxftokXuZIvp5tgAT0LppMDUkMbv2W/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Imposture shrinks from light,
    And dreads the curious eye;
    But sacred truths the test invite,
    They bid us search and try.

    2.
    O may we still maintain
    A meek, inquiring mind,
    Assured we shall not search in vain,
    But hidden treasures find.

    3.
    With understanding blest,
    Created to be free,
    Our faith on man we dare not rest,
    We trust alone in Thee.
 
 

## 755.  The Day of Toil
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B_Y7zVZR0jgb7z2tMPZQ77FmWFHkyahW/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    This is the day of toil
    Beneath earth's sultry noon;
    This is the day of service true,
    But resting cometh soon.

    2.
    Spend and be spent would we,
    While lasteth time's brief day;
    No turning back in coward fear,
    No ling'ring by the way.

    3.
    Onward we press in haste,
    Upward our journey still;
    Ours is the path the Master trod
    Thro' good report and ill.

    4.
    The way may rougher grow,
    The weariness increase,
    We gird our loins and hasten on,
    The end, the end is peace.
 
 

## 756.  Kindred Minds
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BKO6Za3m6n62EHApvh2ASL8is9%2DTkARH/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How blest the sacred tie that binds
    In sweet communion kindred minds!
    How swift the heav'nly course they run,
    Whose hearts, whose faith, whose hopes are one.

    2.
    To each the soul of each how dear!
    What tender love!  what holy fear!
    How does the gen'rous flame within
    Refine from earth and cleanse from sin!

    3.
    Their streaming eyes together flow
    For human guilt and human woe;
    Their ardent prayers together rise,
    Like mingling flames in sacrifice.
 
 

## 757.  Lamp of our Feet
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BiqNCspYSM3gm%2DI5eFglfMmW0cWjohi6/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Lamp of our feet, Whereby we trace
    Our path when wont to stray;
    Stream from the Fount of heav'nly grace;
    Brook by the trav'ler's way;

    2.
    Bread of our souls, Whereon we feed;
    True manna from on high;
    Our guide and chart, wherein we read
    Of realms beyond the sky;

    3.
    Pillar of fire thro' watches dark,
    And radiant cloud by day;
    When waves would whelm our tossing bark,
    Our anchor and our stay;

    4.
    Word of the everlasting God;
    Will of his glorious Son,
    Without thee how could earth be trod,
    Or heav'n itself be won?
 
 

## 759.  Happy the Home
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BoJUAH_9ho9NRDU3rTjzqdBNs_6F0ZRR/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Happy the home when God is there,
    And love fills ev'ry breast;
    When one their wish, and one their prayer.
    And one their heav'nly rest.

    2.
    Happy the home where Jesus' name
    Is sweet to ev'ry ear;
    Where children early lisp his fame,
    And parents hold him dear.

    3.
    Happy the home where prayer is heard,
    And praise is wont to rise;
    Where parents love the sacred word,
    And live out for the skies.

    4.
    Lord, may we in our homes agree,
    This blessed peace to gain;
    Unite our hearts in love to thee,
    And love to all will reign.
 
 

## 760.  The Gospel Lived Out
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdgyjkGeifd4RUgn4bivrol1I6MQB2y5/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    So let our lips and lives express
    The holy gospel we profess;
    So let our works and virtues shine,
    To prove the doctrine all divine.

    2.
    Thus shall we best proclaim abroad
    The honors of our gracious Lord,
    When his salvation reigns within,
    And grace subdues the pow'r of sin.

    3.
    Our flesh and sense must be denied,
    Passion and envy, lust and pride;
    While justice, temp'rance, truth, and love,
    Our inward piety approve.
 
 

## 761.  A Little Light
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C9yGBMf93dIAOrmmIVk6%2DDzauXs2guDs/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God make my life a little light 
    Within the world to glow.
    A little flame that burneth bright,
    Wherever I may go.

    2.
    God make my life a little flow'r,
    That giveth joy to all,
    Content to bloom in native bow'r,
    Altho' the place be small.

    3.
    God make my life a little song
    That comforteth the sad;
    That helpeth others to be strong,
    And makes the singer glad.

    4.
    God make my life a little staff,
    Whereon the weak may rest,
    That so what health and strength I have
    May serve my neighbors best.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C6fb6Z1z2mn1gT0s9sjkUVNbYYAEWugy/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Eternal Father, God of love,
    Creator of the universe,
    Pour out thy Spirit from above,
    As from thy temple we disperse.

    2.
    Keep thou our lips, that all we say
    May honor thee, our God and King;
    That our example day by day
    May teach the sacred truths we sing.

    3.
    Direct our wayward steps aright,
    Our Guide and Guard forever be;
    In thine eternal arms of might
    Enfold and draw us nearer thee.

    1.
    Come, Holy Spirit, heav'nly Dove,
    With all thy quick'ning pow'rs;
    Kindle a flame of sacred love
    In these cold hearts of ours.

    2.
    O raise our thoughts from things below,
    From vanities and toys!
    Then shall we with fresh courage go
    To reach eternal joys.

    3.
    Awake our souls to joyful songs;
    Let pure devotions rise;
    Till praise employs our thankful tongues,
    And doubt forever dies.
 
 

## 764.  The Sacred Book
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BxBKI7AtqLboA9rkLHYeDXyTVScb1Be6/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I love the sacred book of God,
    No other can its place supply;
    It points me to the saints' abode,
    And bids me from destruction fly.

    2.
    Sweet book!  in thee my eyes discern
    The image of my absent Lord;
    From thy instructive page I learn
    The joys his presence will afford.

    3.
    But while I'm here, thou shalt supply 
    His place, and tell me of his love; 
    I'll read with faith's discerning eye,
    And thus partake of joys above.
 
 

## 765.  Amazing Grace
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C66YsgumfnnJT7FoFJzXkURlahIYeuMV/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Amazing grace!  how sweet the sound
    That saved a wretch like me!
    I once was lost, but now am found;
    Was blind, but now I see.

    2.
    'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
    And grace my fears relieved;
    How precious did that grace appear,
    The hour I first believed!

    3.
    Thro' many dangers, toils, and snares,
    I have already come;
    'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
    And grace will lead me home.
 
 

## 766.  'How Precious!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1By0gPyLXYpDsr4JiO49dvGN8D8dwe9Bp/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How precious is the book divine,
    By inspiration giv'n!
    Bright as a lamp its doctrines shine,
    To guide our souls to heav'n.

    2.
    It sweetly cheers our drooping hearts
    In this dark vale of tears,
    And life and light and joy imparts,
    To banish all our fears.

    3.
    This lamp, thro' all the tedious night
    Of life, shall guide our way,
    Till we behold the clearer light
    Of an eternal day.

    1.
    I know that my Redeemer lives,
    And ever prays for me;
    A token of his love he gives,
    A pledge of liberty.

    2.
    Joyful in hope, my spirit soars
    To meet thee from above;
    Thy goodness thankfully adores,
    And tastes thy precious love.

    3.
    When God is mine, and I am his,
    Of paradise possessed,
    I taste unutterable bliss,
    And everlasting rest.

    1.
    Holy Bible!  book divine!
    Precious treasure, thou art mine!
    Mine to tell me whence I came;
    Mine to teach me what I am;

    2.
    Mine to chide me when I rove;
    Mine to show a Saviour's love;
    Mine to guide my wayward feet;
    Mine to judge, condemn, acquit;

    3.
    Mine to comfort in distress,
    If the Holy Spirit bless;
    Mine to show by living faith,
    Man can triumph over death;

    4.
    Mine to tell of joys to come,
    In the saints' eternal home:
    O thou holy Book divine,
    Precious treasure, thou art mine!
 
 

## 769.  My Shepherd
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdomEB%2D_J_9MMg4eswQrQWF3k5Wu4kZM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want;
    He makes me down to lie
    In pastures green; he leadeth me
    The quiet waters by.

    2.
    My soul He doth restore again;
    And me to walk doth make
    Within the paths of righteousness,
    Ev'n for his own name's sake.

    3.
    Yea, tho' I walk in death's dark vale,
    Yet will I fear none ill;
    For thou art with me; and thy rod
    And staff do comfort still.
 
 

## 770.  'God, Our Keeper'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZlXh7VhK%2Duy6oAEIBsIDTdBkXiNLUeT/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God of love that hearest prayer,
    Kindly for thy people care,
    Who on thee alone depend;
    Love us, save us to the end.

    2.
    Save us in the prosp'rous hour,
    From the flatt'ring tempter's pow'r,
    From his unsuspected wiles,
    From the world's pernicious smiles.

    3.
    Cut off our dependence vain
    On the help of feeble man;
    Ev'ry arm of flesh remove;
    Stay us only on thy love!

    4.
    Men of worldly, low design,
    Let not these thy people join;
    Save us from the great and wise,
    Till they sink in their own eyes.
     
 
 

## 771.  'Zion, Awake!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AmUlKTyeUxVtIcKVFoYb3%2DH90S%2D5ces1/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Zion, awake!  thy slumber break;
    No longer in thy sins lie down;
    His garment of salvation take,
    His beauty and His strength put on.

    2.
    Shake off the dust that blinds thy sight,
    And hides the promise from thine eyes;
    Arise, and struggle into light;
    Thy great Deliv'rer calls, Arise!

    3.
    Vessels of mercy, sons of grace,
    Be purged from ev'ry sinful stain;
    Be like your Lord, his word embrace,
    Nor bear his hallow'd name in vain.
 
 

## 772.  'Love''s Golden Chain'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AjgQpv0hEYykA7FR7Y0UNzSobgP_1fUe/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How sweet, how heav'nly is the sight,
    When those who love the Lord
    In one another's peace delight,
    And thus fulfill his word!

    2.
    When, free from envy, scorn, and pride,
    Our wishes all above,
    Each can his brother's failings hide,
    And show a brother's love!

    3.
    Love is the golden chain that binds
    The trusting soul above;
    And he's an heir of heav'n who finds
    His bosom glow with love.
 
 

## 773.  Preach My Gospel
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Am3_sG71Zk4Y3qQD%2DQHwMNCn4CiSPpqf/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    "Go, preach my gospel," saith the Lord;
    "Bid the whole world my grace receive;
    He shall be saved who trusts my word,
    And they condemned who disbelieve.

    2.
    "I'll make your great commission known,
    And ye shall prove my gospel true
    By all the works that I have done,
    By all the wonders ye shall do.

    3.
    "Teach all the nations my commands;
    I'm with you till the world shall end;
    All pow'r is vested in my hands;
    I can destroy, and I defend."
 
 

## 774.  The Day Is Past
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AJ7TwfhBAoNal3dDEeimjikWgYKNuZp0/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The day is past and gone,
    The evening shades appear;
    O, may we all remember well
    The night of death draws near.

    2.
    Lord, keep us safe this night,
    Secure from all our fears;
    May angels guard us while we sleep,
    Till morning light appears.

    3.
    When all our days are past,
    And we from time remove,
    O, may we in thy bosom rest
    The bosom of thy love.
 
 

## 775.  Sun of My Soul
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARq8srcw%2DEywX5_0FbGvwLgaBottaQP9/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Sun of my soul, O Saviour dear!
    It is not night if thou be near:
    O may no earth-born cloud arise
    To hide thee from thy servant's eyes.

    2.
    When soft the dews of kindly sleep
    My weary eyelids gently steep,
    Be my fast thought bow sweet to rest
    Forever on my Saviour's breast!

    3.
    Abide with me from morn till eve,
    For without thee I cannot live;
    Abide with me when night is nigh,
    For without thee I dare not die.

    4.
    Be near and bless me when I wake,
    Ere thro' the world my way I take;
    Till in the ocean of thy love
    I lose myself in heav'n above.
 
 

## 776.  In the Morning
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Aa63IKSwTMqqQSjSVViPxgPUoNb_PCzM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear
    My voice ascending high;
    To thee will I direct my prayer,
    To thee lift up mine eye,

    2.
    O may thy Spirit guide my feet
    In ways of righteousness!
    Make ev'ry path of duty straight
    And plain before my face.

    3.
    The men that love and fear thy name
    Shall see their hopes fulfilled;
    The mighty God will compass them
    With favor as a shield.
 
 

## 777.  The Living Law
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AH7hHIAeArqMUowLQfcFHTiOdiZH6lqM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    My blest Redeemer and my Lord,
    I read my duty in thy word;
    But in thy life the law appears,
    Drawn out in living characters.

    2.
    What truth and love thy bosom fill!
    What zeal to do thy Father's will!
    Such zeal, and truth, and love divine
    I would transcribe, and make them mine.

    3.
    Cold mountains and the midnight air
    Witnessed the fervor of thy prayer;
    The desert thy temptations new,
    Thy conflict, and thy vict'ry too.

    4.
    Be thou my pattern; make me bear
    More of thy gracious image;
    Then God, the Judge, shall own my name
    Among the foll'wers of the Lamb.
 
 

## 778.  Sabbath Eve
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ATwSZ6RpA8FwrtqLUWpnLZgXs4rMGQtO/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How sweet the light of Sabbath eve!
    How soft the sunbeams ling'ring there!
    For these blest hours the world I leave,
    Wafted on wings of faith and pray'r.

    2.
    Season of rest!  the tranquil soul
    Feels the sweet calm, and melts in love;
    And while these sacred moments roll,
    Faith sees a smiling heav'n above.

    3.
    Nor will our days of toil be long;
    Our pilgrimage will soon be trod;
    And we shall join the ceaseless song,
    The endless Sabbath of our God.
 
 

## 779.  Truth Crushed to Earth
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AtLIIj_Qp_aDQSu3MR7otuNELXKnIi8d/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Truth, crush'd to earth, shall rise again.
    Th' eternal years of God are hers; 
    But Error, wounded, writhes in pain.
    And dies among his worshipers.

    2.
    Heed not the shaft by hatred cast,
    The foul and hissing bolt of scorn;
    For with the right shall dwell at last
    The vict'ry of endurance born.  

    3.
    Yea, tho' thou lie upon the dust,
    When all thy helpers flee in fear,
    Die full of hope and manly trust,
    Like those who fell for freedom dear.

    4.
    Some other arm thy sword wield,
    Some other hand the standard wave,
    Till from the trumpet's mouth is pealed
    The blast of triumph o'er thy grave.
 
 

## 780.  The One Thing Needful
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ajm9WSsKSHEcridnnMwiEMN4Mzp8Nxcm/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jesus, engrave it on my heart
    That thou the one thing needful art;
    I could from all things parted be,
    But never, never, Lord, from thee.

    2.
    Needful is thy most precious blood,
    To reconcile my soul to God;
    Needful in thy indulgent care,
    Needful thy all prevailing prayer.

    3.
    Needful art thou, my Guide, my Stay,
    Thro' all life's dark and weary way;
    Nor will at last less needful be
    To bring me home to heav'n and thee.
 
 

## 781.  Be Not Afraid
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EzkN8FgUk3YwRQIuyZOY5Y4Z2U33B3Kc/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    When pow'r divine, in mortal form,
    Hush'd with a word the raging storm,
    In soothing accents Jesus said, 
    "Lo, it is I; be not afraid."

    2.
    So when in silence nature sleeps,
    And lonely watch the mourner keeps,
    One thought shall ev'ry pang remove,
    Trust, feeble man, thy Maker's love.

    3.
    And when the last dread hour shall come,
    While trembling nature waits her doom,
    This voice shall wake the righteous dead
    "Lo, it is I; be not afraid."
 
 

## 782.  'God, Our Refuge'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EzBG71LkKojW2lL7gmebz__y7SYkmJMO/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God is the refuge of his saints
    When storms of sharp distress invade
    Ere we can offer our complaints,
    Behold him present with his aid.

    2.
    Loud may the troubled ocean roar;
    In sacred peace our souls abide;
    While ev'ry nation, ev'ry shore,
    Trembles, and dreads the swelling tide.

    3.
    Zion enjoys her Monarch's love,
    Secure against a threat'ning hour;
    Nor can her firm foundation move,
    Built on his truth, and armed with pow'r.
 
 

## 783.  Leave the Rest to God
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnK4abBq87G%2DAg_f3RuyOnfLX1NpNQb4/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    He who seeks the truth, and trembles
    At the dangers he must brave,
    Merits not the name of Freeman;
    He at best is but a slave.

    2.
    Be thou like the noble ancients:
    Scorn the threat that bids thee fear;
    Speak!  no matter what betide thee;
    Let them strike, but let them hear.

    3.
    Be thou like the first apostles,
    Be thou like heroic Paul;
    If a free thought seeks expression,
    Speak it boldly!  speak it all!

    4.
    Fearlessly face thine accusers!
    Scorn the prison, rack, or rod!
    If thou hast a truth to utter,
    Speak, and leave the rest to God.
 
 

## 784.  Be Near Us
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EtkuvIHmjk_F%2DMblBy30y9imBRGqbk9n/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God of our salvation, hear us;
    Bless, O bless us, ere we go;
    When we join the world, be near us,
    Lest we cold and careless grow.

    2.
    May we live in view of heaven,
    Where we hope to see thy face;
    Let thy Spirit's light be given,
    All our hidden paths to trace.

    3.
    As our steps are drawing nearer
    To the place we call our home,
    May our view of heav'n grow clearer,
    Hope more bright of joys to come.
 
 

## 785.  Control My Will
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FF5dBS7MkJp2e9zEP97IVshoORJrQu98/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Prince of Peace, control my will,
    Bid this struggling heart be still;
    Bid my fears and doubtings cease,
    Hush my spirit into peace.

    2.
    Thou hast bought me with thy blood,
    Open'd wide the gate to God;
    Peace, I ask, but peace must be,
    Lord, in being one with thee.

    3.
    May thy will, not mine, be done,
    May thy will and mine be one;
    Chase these doubtings from my heart,
    Now thy perfect peace impart.
 
 

## 786.  The Pure in Heart
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ExlC_LoUPNHlaEeqZ_afac8BbkftUGeb/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Blest are the pure in heart,
    For they our God shall see,
    And from his presence ne'er depart
    Thro' all eternity.

    2.
    I will be their delight
    Who here delight in me,
    And they shall walk with me in white
    Who seek for purity.

    3.
    No more in thought they err,
    They're free from ev'ry stain;
    They've wash'd their robes of character,
    And spotless they remain.
 
 

## 787.  Thine Own
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ezi_qLCJnr37BA7eRFz5VBz6X08BFKNo/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    We give Thee but thine own,
    Whate'er the gift may be:
    All that we have is thine alone,
    A trust, O Lord, from thee.

    2.
    To comfort and to bless,
    To find a balm for woe,
    To tend the lone and fatherless,
    Is angels' work below.

    3.
    The captive to release,
    To God the lost to bring,
    To teach the way of life and peace,
    It is a Christ-like thing.
 
 

## 788.  Be on Thy Guard
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F0f1u6IDdpSQIeZcianQkaKu1WdAN7EM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    My soul, be on thy guard!
    Ten thousand foes arise;
    The hosts of sin are pressing hard
    To draw thee from the skies.

    2.
    O watch, and fight, and pray!
    The battle ne'er give o'er;
    Renew it boldly ev'ry day
    And help divine implore.

    3.
    Ne'er think the vict'ry won,
    Nor lay thine armor down;
    Thy arduous task will not be done
    Till thou obtain the crown.
 
 

## 789.  Firm As a Rock
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EsLPhBjZ0H9_UupOAX50CCXgtK6FTruC/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Unshaken as the sacred hills,
    And fix'd as mountains stand;
    Firm as a rock the soul shall rest
    That trusts th' Almighty hand.

    2.
    Not walls nor hills could guard so well
    Fair Salem's happy ground,
    As these eternal arms of love
    That ev'ry saint surround.

    3.
    Do good, O Lord, do good to those
    Who cleave to thee in heart,
    Who on thy truth alone repose,
    Nor from thy law depart.
 
 

## 790.  One Living Faith
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EjwmyO9NSEFHVZUleMnGk1ltKN3y41Lg/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God's law demands one living faith,
    And not a crowd of lifeless creeds;
    Its warrant is a firm "God saith;"
    Its claim not words, but living deeds.

    2.
    O Lord, forgive thy holy law
    Grows tarnish'd in our earthly clasp;
    Pure in itself, without a flaw
    It dims in our too worldly grasp.

    3.
    Forgive the sacrilege, and take
    From ev'ry soul th' unholy stain,
    And help us for thy Son's dear sake,
    To keep thy perfect law again.
 
 

## 791.  A Soldier of the Cross
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DTTAAP6ugTDHu%2DurAfecPF1Jala%2Dz1lM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Am I a soldier of the cross,
    A foll'wer of the Lamb?
    And shall I fear to own his cause,
    Or blush to speak his name?
    Or blush to speak his name?

    2.
    Must I be carried to the skies
    On flow'ry beds of ease,
    Whilst others fought to win the prize,
    And sailed thro' bloody seas?
    And sailed thro' bloody seas?

    3.
    Are there no foes for me to face?
    Must I not stem the flood?
    Is this vile world a friend of grace,
    To help me on to God?
    To help me on to God?

    4.
     Sure I must fight if I would reign;
    Increase my courage, Lord;
    I'll hear the toil, endure the pain,
    Supported by thy word,
    Supported by thy word.
 
 

## 792.  Each Returning Morn
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CxwN1xQf5aEGmPKiqYjIyYg4s76qE6vd/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Christ, with each returning morn
    Thine image to our hearts be borne;
    And may we ever clearly see
    Our dearest treasure, Lord, in thee!

    2.
    All hallowed be our walk this day;
    May meekness form our morning ray,
    And faithful love our noontide light,
    And hope our sunset, calm and bright.

    3.
    May grace each idle thought control,
    And sanctify each wayward soul;
    May guile depart, and malice cease,
    And all within be joy and peace.
 
 

## 793.  Stretch Every Nerve
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CzFBwgyT9da9%2DbygO7qzbUDeA_QrEQ%2D%2D/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Awake my soul!  stretch ev'ry nerve,
    And press with vigor on;
    A heav'nly race demands thy zeal,
    And an immortal crown.

    2.
    'Tis God's all animating voice,
    That calls thee from on high;
    'Tis he whose hand presents the prize
    To thine aspiring eye.

    3.
    A cloud of witnesses around,
    Hold thee in full survey;
    Forget the steps already trod,
    And onward urge thy way.

    4.
    Blest Saviour, introduced by thee,
    Our race have we begun;
    And, crown'd with vict'ry, at thy feet
    We'll lay our trophies down.
 
 

## 794.  New Every Morning
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ChbHbAfYp7gDknRK0zwDF8%2Dpz2bJQupw/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    New ev'ry morning is Thy love,
    This our awak'ning powers prove,
    Thro' sleep and darkness safely bro't
    Back into life and strength and tho't.

    2.
    New mercies each returning day
    Hover around us while we pray,
    New perils past, new sins forgiv'n,
    New tho'ts of God, new hopes of heav'n.

    3.
    O may we thankfully receive,
    And rightly use what Thou dost give,
    So shall new blessings still be ours,
    New consecration claim our pow'rs.
 
 

## 795.  Spend And Be Spent
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CeORs5b2FS6oUZQQ0osT0DUboq_ve2He/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Go, labor on; spend and be spent,
    Thy joy to do the Father's will;
    It is the way the Master went;
    Should not the servant tread it still?

    2.
    Go, labor on; 'tis not for naught;
    Thine earthly loss is heav'nly gain:
    Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not:
    The Master praises, what are men?

    3.
    Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice;
    For toil comes rest; for exile, home;
    Soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom's voice,
    The midnight peal:  "Behold, I come!"
 
 

## 796.  Gently Think and Speak
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DDdhazW0FdSKO8cJew47GrT8V0H%2Dsc15/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Gently think, and gently speak,
    Art thou strong?  respect the weak;
    Art thou weak?  from what thou art,
    Gently touch another's heart.

    2.
    He who knew the thoughts of men,
    Gentle was; O let us then
    Careful be in thought and tone,
    We, who scarce can read our own.

    3.
    Rain and dews, and sunshine fall,
    With unbounded love, on all;
    Shall my narrow heart refuse
    Its poor sun, and rain, and dews?

    4.
    Then be gentle, O my soul,
    Thoughts and words alike control;
    If thou must in aught decide,
    Err upon the gentle side.
 
 

## 797.  In Lowly Paths
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D7dFHLXBKdPj0khDCePKlRAEhBQ7GP3M/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Master, let me walk with thee
    In lowly paths of service free;
    Tell me thy secret, help me bear
    The strain of toil, the fret o care.

    2.
    Help me the slow of heart to move
    By some clear winning word of love;
    Teach me the wayward feet to stay,
    And guide them in the homeward way.

    3.
    Teach me thy patience; still with thee
    In closer, dearer company,
    In work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
    In trust that triumphs over wrong;

    4.
    In hope that sends a shining ray
    Far down the future's broad'ning way;
    In peace that wealth can never give,
    With thee, O Master, let me live.
 
 

## 798.  Though Nature Weeps
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D0wJT4Wr6ufN80tMyIZLaOfWQ_zka_w_/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Lovely this child, asleep in death;
    How beautiful and fair!
    Yes, even now, tho' void of breath,
    God's impress still is there.

    2.
    And if thus fair and lovely here,
    Beneath death's icy hand,
    O will it not be beauteous there,
    'Mid the immortal band?

    3.
    Tho' nature weeps when holy ties
    So strongly bound are riv'n,
    Yet faith the Saviour's word applies,
    "Of such the realms of heav'n."
 
 

## 799.  Thine Approbation
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DARDlNr7QU6op8ghGwtKfWKhAB80KHPl/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    One precious boon, O Lord, I seek,
    While tossed upon life's billowy sea;
    To hear a voice within me speak,
    "Thy Saviour is well pleased with thee."

    2.
    Earth's scoffs and scorn well pleased I'll bear,
    Nor mourn tho' under foot I'm trod,
    If day by day I may but share
    Thine approbation, O my God!

    3.
    Let me but know, where'er I roam,
    That I am doing Jesus' will;
    And tho' I've neither friends nor home,
    My heart shall glow with gladness still.
 
 

## 800.  Sabbath Twilight
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D2Fux_70HdcxzpUgZUQDz0eGOuRWvCin/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Softly fades the twilight ray
    Of the holy Sabbath-day,
    Gently as life's setting sun
    When the Christian's course is run.

    2.
    Peace is on the world abroad;
    'Tis the holy peace of God,
    Symbol of the peace within
    When the spirit rests from sin.

    3.
    Saviour, may our Sabbaths be
    Days of joy and peace in Thee,
    Till in heav'n our souls repose, 
    Where the Sabbath ne'er shall close.
 
 

## 801.  The Mercy Seat
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wJHWjGBMUQvpQ2lTV0li0ioGtSk_miTX/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    From every stormy wind that blows,
    From ev'ry swelling tide of woes,
    There is a calm, a sure retreat;
    'Tis found above the mercy seat.

    2.
    There is a scene where spirits blend,
    Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
    Though sundered far, by faith they meet
    Around one common mercy seat.

    3.
    Ah!  whither should we flee for aid,
    When tempted, desolate, dismayed?
    Or how the hosts of sin defeat,
    Had suff'ring saints no mercy seat?
 
 

## 802.  Communing With Thee
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wC%2DPnOR8Qn661Xt02CFW8Ts3alKXwGmA/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Softy now the light of day
    Fades upon our sight away;
    Free from care, from labor free,
    Lord, we would commune with thee.

    2.
    Thou, whose all pervading eye
    Naught escapes, without, within,
    Pardon each infirmity,
    Open fault, and secret sin.

    3.
    Soon from us the light of day
    Shall forever pass away;
    Thou, from sin and sorrow free,
    Take us, Lord, to dwell with thee.
 
 

## 803.  Blessed Bible
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAPOga%2Do403U1bz0nKjUKrfHPTIaZcwI/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Blessed Bible, how I love it!
    How it doth my bosom cheer!
    What hath earth like this to covet?
    O, what stores of wealth are here!

    2.
    'Tis a fountain ever bursting,
    Whence the weary may obtain
    Water for the soul that's thirsting,
    That it may not thirst again.

    3.
    'Tis a chart that never faileth,
    One which God to man has giv'n;
    And tho' oft the storm assaileth,
    It will guide us safe to heav'n.

    4.
    'Tis a pearl of price exceeding
    All the gems in ocean found;
    All its sacred precepts heeding,
    So shall we in grace abound.
 
 

## 804.  Thou Hast Left Us
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNMsubj7tGw5%2DhBG3yNuou9J7i14niCL/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Sister, thou wast mild and lovely,
    Gentle as the summer breeze;
    Pleasant as the air of evening
    When it floats among the trees.

    2.
    Dearest sister, thou hast left us!
    Here thy loss we deeply feel;
    But 'tis God that hath berelf us,
    He can all our sorrows heal.

    3.
    Yet again we hope to meet thee,
    When this mortal life is fled;
    Then, in heav'n, with joy to greet thee,
    Where no farewell tear is shed.
 
 

## 805.  Guide and Guard Us
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wSo8E29D7dRoji4HqGgO_nKe9pM6NC0K/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Guide and guard us, O our Father,
    Till another Sabbath-day;
    Shield us with Thy holy presence,
    Lead us in the righteous way.

    2.
    Now we thank Thee for Thy blessing
    On this sacred day of rest,
    And for truths which Thou hast shown us
    In Thy word divinely blest.

    3.
    Ev'ry day and ev'ry moment
    We are safe if Thou art near;
    From all danger Thou canst rescue,
    In our sorrows Thou canst cheer.

    4.
    We will trust Thy constant watch-care,
    For Thou knowest what is best;
    O, forever guide and guard us,
    Till we reach our final rest!
 
 

## 806.  Thy Will Be Done
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wDWn2vEIn7l%2D95RKWiReBvQI11zpWDcd/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jesus, while our hearts are bleeding,
    O'er the spoils that death has won,
    We would at this solemn meeting,
    Calmly say, "Thy will be done."

    2.
    Tho' cast down, we're not forsaken;
    Tho' afflicted, not alone;
    Thou didst give, and Thou hast taken;
    Blessed Lord, Thy will be done.

    3.
    By Thy hands the boon was given,
    Thou hast taken but Thine own;
    Lord of earth, and God of heaven,
    Evermore Thy will be done.
 
 

## 807.  Day By Day
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w_Lt0zV_nfmbS1ursID0m6BUg62RTCRz/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Day by day the manna fell;
    O to learn this lesson well!
    Still by constant mercy fed,
    Give me, Lord, our daily bread.

    2.
    "Day by day," the promise reads
    Daily strength for daily needs;
    Cast foreboding fears away,
    Take the manna of today.

    3.
    Lord, our times are in thy hand;
    All our sanguine hopes have plann'd
    To thy wisdom we resign,
    And would mold our wills to thine.

    4.
    Thou our daily task shalt give;
    Day by day to thee we live;
    So shall added years fulfil
    Not our own, our Father's will.
 
 

## 808.  Thy Judgments Abroad
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wfS6AryaqQTU7Pc6jFRoEWfUMTz7l6uG/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    In grief and fear, to thee, O Lord,
    We now for succor fly;
    Thine awful judgments are abroad,
    O shield us, lest we die.

    2.
    O look with pity on the scene 
    Of sadness and of dread;
    And let thine angel stand between
    The living and the dead.

    3.
    With contrite hearts to thee, our King,
    We turn who oft have strayed;
    Accept the sacrifice we bring,
    And let the plague be stayed.
 
 

## 809.  'What Is the Chaff?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wSJqJSnjkce_oIls22fS9PUYOoMdgLuq/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    What is the chaff, the word of man,
    When set against the wheat?
    Can it a dying soul sustain
    Like that immortal meat?

    2.
    Thy word, O God, with heav'nly bread
    Thy children doth supply;
    And those who by thy word are fed,
    Their souls shall never die.

    3.
    'Tis like a field where hidden lies
    The pearl of price unknown,
    And he indeed is truly wise
    Who makes this pearl his own.
 
 

## 810.  Away from Care
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wLFwGOnNxxBUeqB3fGZju8gEEprdh9JF/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I love to steal awhile away
    From ev'ry cumb'ring care,
    And spend the hours of setting day
    In humble, grateful prayer.

    2.
    I love in solitude to shed
    The penitential tear;
    And all His promises to plead,
    Where none but God can hear.

    3.
    I love to think on mercies past,
    And future good implore;
    And all my cares and sorrows cast
    On Him whom I adore.

    4.
    I love by faith to take a view
    Of brighter scenes to come;
    The prospect doth my strength renew
    While here away from home.

    1.
    Walk in the light! so shalt thou know
    That fellowship of love His Spirit only can bestow
    Who reigns in light above,
    Who reigns in light above.

    2.
    Walk in the light!  and thou shalt own 
    Thy darkness passed away;
    Because that light on thee hath shone
    In which is perfect day,
    In which is perfect day.

    3.
    Walk in the light!  and e'en the tomb
    No fearful shade shall wear;
    Glory shall chase away its gloom,
    For Christ hath conquered there,
    For Christ hath conquered there.

    4.
    Walk in the light!  and thine shall be 
    A path, tho' theory, bright;
    For God, by grace, shall dwell in thee,
    And God himself is light,
    And God himself is light.

    1.
    Father, whate'er of earthly bliss
    Thy sov'reign will denies,
    Accepted at thy throne of grace,
    Let this petition rise:

    2.
    Give me a calm, a thankful heart,
    From ev'ry murmur free;
    The blessings of thy grace impart,
    And make me live to thee.

    3.
    Let the sweep hope that thou art mine
    My life and death attend;
    Thy presence thro' my journey shine,
    And crown my journey's end.
 
 

## 813.  Above These Shades
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y0FO%2DCLIUF3Fwfrw6zuCvVaz%2DvBPiR_a/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O could our thoughts and wishes fly,
    Above these gloomy shades,
    To those bright worlds beyond the sky,
    Where sorrow ne'er invades!

    2.
    There, joys unseen by mortal eyes,
    Or reason's feeble ray,
    In ever blooming prospect rise,
    Exposes to no decay.

    3.
    Lord, send a beam of light divine,
    To guide our upward aim;
    With one reviving look of thine,
    Our languid hearts inflame.

    4.
    O then, on faith's sublimest wing,
    Our ardent souls shall rise,
    To those bright scenes where pleasures spring
    Immortal in the skies.
 
 

## 814.  We Walk by Faith
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y1Hpy5xjS61N3Vbh7H0PmjC1Dt9qtstb/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    'Tis by the faith of joys to come
    We walk thro' deserts dark as night;
    Till we arrive at heav'n, our home,
    Truth is our guide, and faith our light.

    2.
    The want of sight she well supplies;
    She makes the pearly gates appear;
    Far into distant worlds she pries,
    And brings eternal glories near.

    3.
    Tho' lions roar, and tempests blow,
    And rocks and dangers fill the way,
    With joy we tread the desert thro',
    While faith inspires a heav'nly ray.

    1.
    Gentle Peace, from heav'n descended,
    We would live beneath thy law;
    Thou hast home and life befriended
    Born of nobler deeds than war.

    2.
    Thou hast thrown a smile of beauty
    O'er the meadow, hill, and grove;
    Thou hast quickened us to duty,
    Thou hast warmed our hearts to love.

    3.
    Stay thou with us, still replenish
    Fields with fruit, ourselves with love;
    Discord and dissension banish,
    Peaceful spirits from above.

    1.
    My country, 'tis of thee,
    Sweet land of liberty,
    Of thee I sing;
    Land where my fathers died,
    Land of the pilgrims' pride,
    From ev'ry mountain side
    Let freedom ring.

    2.
    My native country, thee,
    Land of the noble, free,
    Thy name I love;
    I love thy rocks and rills,
    Thy woods and templed hills;
    My heart with rapture thrills
    Like that above.

    3.
    Let music swell the breeze,
    And ring from all the trees
    Sweet freedom's song;
    Let mortal tongues awake,
    Let all that breathe partake,
    Let rocks their silence break,
    The sound prolong.

    4.
    Our fathers' God, to thee,
    Author of liberty,
    To thee we sing;
    Long may our land be bright
    With freedom's holy light;
    Protect us by thy might,
    Great God, our King.

    1.
    O God, beneath thy guiding hand,
    Our exiled fathers cross the sea;
    And when they trod the wintry strand,
    With pray'r and psalm they worshiped thee.

    2.
    Truth, freedom, justice, faith in God,
    Came with those exiles o'er the waves;
    And where their pilgrim feet have trod,
    The God they trusted guards their graves.

    3.
    And here thy name, O God of love,
    May we, their children, still adorn,
    Till these eternal hills remove,
    And spring adorns the earth no more.

    1.
    God bless our native land!
    May Heaven's protecting hand
    Still guard our shore.
    May peace her pow'r extend,
    Foe be transformed to friend,
    And all our rights depend
    On war no more.

    2.
    May just and righteous laws
    Uphold the public cause,
    And bless our name;
    Home of the brave and free,
    Stronghold of Liberty,
    We pray that still on thee
    May rest no stain.

    3.
    And not this land alone,
    But be thy mercies known
    From shore to shore;
    O that all men would see
    That they should brothers be,
    And form one family,
    The wide world o'er!

    1.
    The Lord worketh, let us work too;
    In his vineyard there's much to do,
    And souls perish for need of you:
    The Lord worketh, let us work too.

    2.
    The world moveth, let us move too,
    The Sun's glory that we may view.
    From night turning to day dawn new;
    The world moveth, let us move too.

    3.
    The wrong speaketh, let us speak too;
    The worst error is bright with dew;
    Shall truth slumber the whole day thro'?
    The wrong speaketh, let us speak too.

    4.
    The Christ liveth, let us live too.
    From death waking, his work to do,
    With hearts loving and pure and true:
    The Christ liveth, let us live too.

    1.
    Shepherd divine, thou leadest me
    Where the still waters gently flow;
    In pastures fair thou feedest me;
    I trust thy love, no want I know.

    2.
    In danger's hour thou hidest me,
    Safe from the foe of thy dear flock;
    At sultry noon thou guidest me
    To rest beside the cooling rock.

    3.
    When chilling dews of evening fall,
    Then to the fold thou bidst me come;
    Gladly I hasten at thy call;
    Sweet is the voice that calls me home.

    2.
    For Jesus, all the songs I sing,
    For Jesus, all the praise I bring,
    For Jesus, he who bore death's sting,
    My Jesus; all for Jesus.

    3.
    For Jesus, all the gold he leads,
    For Jesus, all the strength he sends,
    For Jesus, heart and home and friends,
    For Jesus, all for Jesus.

    4.
    For Jesus, all who sigh in sin,

    For Jesus, King enthroned within,
    Yes, all, and more, for Jesus.

    Another year with thee.

    2.
    Another year of mercies,
    Of faithfulness and grace,
    Another year of gladness,
    The shining of thy face.

    For holier work above.

    1.
    Calm me, my God, and keep me calm,
    Reclining on Thy breast;
    Soothe me with holy hymn and psalm,
    And bid my spirit rest.

    2.
    Yes, keep me calm, tho' loud and rude
    The sounds my ear that greet,
    Calm in the closet's solitude,
    Calm in the bustling street;

    3.
    Calm in the hour of buoyant health,
    Calm in the hour of pain,
    Calm in my poverty or wealth,
    Calm in my loss or gain;

    4.
    Calm in the sufferance of wrong,
    Like Him who bore my shame;
    Calm 'mid the threat'ning, taunting throng,
    Who hate Thy holy name;

    5.
    Calm as the ray of sun or star,
    Which storms assail in vain,
    Moving unruffled thro' earth's war,
    Th' eternal calm to gain.

    Call Jehovah thy salvation,
    Rest beneath th' Almighty's shade;
    In His secret habitation
    Dwell, and never be dismayed.

    2.
    Since, with pure and firm affection
    Thou on God hast set thy love,
    With the wings of His protection
    He will shield thee from above.

    3.
    Thou shalt call on Him in trouble,
    He will hearken, He will save;
    For thy grief reward thee double,
    Crown with life beyond the grave.  Amen.

    1.
    O blessed hour, when ev'ning comes,
    And calls us to our place of pray'r!
    With joyful heart our feet we turn
    To meet Thee and Thy children there.

    2.
    With one accord we gather here,
    Our wants make known, our sins confess;
    Dear Saviour, wilt Thou now appear
    And bless, as only Thou canst bless.

    3.
    Our faith increase, our fears remove,
    Make strong the weak, the helpless raise;
    May ev'ry heart now feel Thy love,
    And ev'ry tongue speak forth Thy praise.

    4.
    No want have we Thou canst not fill,
    No need but Thou canst fully meet;

    And find our lives in Thee complete.

    1.
    O Love divine, that stooped to share
    Our sharpest pang, our bitterest tear!
    On thee we cast each earth-born care;
    We smile at pain while thou art near.

    2.
    When drooping pleasure turns to grief,
    And trembling faith is changed to fear,
    The murm'ring wind, the quiv'ring leaf,
    Shall softly tell us, "Thou art near!"

    3.
    On thee we fling our burd'ning woe,
    O love divine, forever dear;
    Content to suffer while we know,
    Living or dying, thou art near.

    1.
    O blest are they who oft have said, 
    "I thirst for righteousness;
    I hunger for the heav'nly Bread
    With anguish and distress."

    2.
    They of My fulness shall be fed,
    For which they hungered sore;
    And by the Living Waters led,
    Their souls shall thirst no more.

    3.
    Because I am the Truth, the Life,
    All fulness dwells in me;
    They know no want, no sin, no strife,
    Thro' all eternity.

    4.
    How blessed, then, to share a part
    With those that hunger here;
    To have the panting, thirsty heart,
    And shed the bitter tear!

    God of my life, whose gracious pow'r
    Thro' varied scenes my soul hath led,
    Or turned aside the fatal hour,
    Or lifted up my sinking head,

    2.
    I have no skill the snare to shun,
    But thou, O God, my wisdom art:
    I ever into danger run,
    But thou art greater than my heart.

    3.
    I rest beneath thy kindly shade;
    My griefs expire, my troubles cease;
    Thou, Lord, on whom my soul is stayed,
    Wilt keep me still in perfect peace.

    I would desire to be;
    By day, by night, at home, abroad,
    I would be still with thee.

    2.
    With thee when dawn comes in,
    And calls me back to care,
    Each day returning to begin
    With thee, my God, in pray'r.

    3.
    With thee when day is done,
    And evening calms the mind;
    The setting, as the rising sun,
    With thee my heart would find.

    4.
    With thee, in thee, by faith
    Abiding I would be;
    By day, by night, in life, in death,
    I would be still with thee.
 
 

## 830.  The Larger Prayer
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvKfbDNBbP%2D3Y%2DLoDbk_HuodJajybsin/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    At first I prayed for light:
    Could I but see the way,
    How gladly, swiftly would I walk
    To everlasting day!

    2.
    And next I prayed for strength:
    That I might tread the road
    With firm, unfalt'ring, feet and win
    The heaven's serene abode.

    3.
    And then I asked for faith:
    Could I but trust my God,
    I'd live unfolded in His peace,
    Tho' foes were all abroad.

    4.
    But now I pray for love:
    Deep love to God and man;
    A living love that will not fail,
    However dark His plan.

    5.
    And light and strength and faith
    Are opening everywhere!
    God waited patiently until
    I prayed the larger pray'r.
 
 

## 831.  Rest in Thee
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tHOfcrVWC7akEmhhlgfHMpDAVH4vtEh3/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Come, thou long-expected Jesus,
    Born to set Thy people free:
    From our fears and sins release us,
    Let us find our rest in Thee.

    2.
    Born Thy people to deliver,
    Born a child, and yet a King;
    Born to reign in us forever,
    Now Thy gracious Kingdom bring.

    3.
    By Thine own eternal Spirit,
    Rule in all our hearts alone;
    By Thine all-sufficient merit,
    Raise us to Thy glorious throne.
 
 

## 832.  Our Words
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tO3u6Hn5qI3_0OSX347PJL9JicDET7bZ/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Words are things of little cost,
    Quickly spoken, quickly lost;
    We forget them, but they stand
    Witnesses at God's right hand,
    And their testimony bear
    For us or against us there.

    2.
    Oh, how often ours have been
    Idle words and words of sin!
    Words of anger, scorn, or pride,
    Or deceit, our faults to hide,
    Envious tales, or strife unkind,
    Leaving bitter thoughts behind.

    3.
    Grant us, Lord, from day to day,
    Strength to watch and grace to pray:
    May our lips from sin kept free,
    Love to speak and sing of Thee;
    Till in heav'n we learn to raise
    Hymns of everlasting praise.
 
 

## 833.  'How Shall I Copy Him?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1suia5_7qZmWc413lO5zAfz3OX_yHVy3V/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How shall I follow Him I serve?
    How shall I copy Him I love?
    Nor from those blessed footsteps swerve
    Which lead me to His seat above?

    2.
    Lord, should my path thro' suffering lie,
    Forbid that I should e'er repine;
    Still let me turn to Calvary,
    Nor heed my grief, rememb'ring Thine.

    3.
    O let me think, how Thou didst leave
    Thy heav'nly home of pure delights,
    To fast, to faint, to watch, to grieve,
    Thro' toilsome days, thro' lonely nights!

    4.
    All this Thou didst, then died for me!
    Thou camest not Thyself to please;
    And, dear tho' earthly comforts be,
    Shall I not love Thee more then these?
 
 

## 834.  'Speak, That I May Speak'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tNvFqTgEHaWl0ymEZNBKbVqJ2kKj7db9/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Lord, speak to me, that I may speak
    In living echoes of Thy tone;
    As Thou hast sought, so let me seek
    Thy erring children lost and lone.

    2.
    O lead me, Lord, that I may lead
    The wand'ring and the wav'ring feet;
    O feed me, Lord, that I may feed
    Thy hung'ring ones with manna sweet.

    3.
    O strengthen me, that while I stand
    Firm on the Rock, and strong in Thee,
    I may stretch out a loving hand
    To wrestlers with the troubled sea.
 
 

## 835.  Sleep Not
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tD5fpQajo7hJISEN50iVNxjSsjVsDYf0/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Sleep not, soldier of the cross;
    Foes are lurking all around:
    Look not here to find repose;
    This is but thy battle ground.

    2.
    Up, and take thy shield and sword;
    Up, it is the call of heav'n;
    Shrink not faithless from thy Lord,
    Nobly strive as He hath striv'n.

    3.
    Break thro' all the force of ill,
    Treat the might of passion down,
    Struggle onward, onward still,
    To the conqu'ring Saviour's crown.

    4.
    Thro' the midst of toil and pain,
    Let this tho't ne'er leave thy breast,
    Ev'ry triumph thou dost gain
    Makes more sweet thy coming rest.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tKgDw6a9AU1zTHqgR09LYIEjAHsP59B8/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O teach me, Lord, that I may teach
    The precious things Thou dost impart;
    And wing my words, that they may reach
    The hidden depths of many a heart.

    2.
    O fill me with Thy fulness, Lord,
    Until my very heart o'erflow
    In kindly tho't and glowing word,
    Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.

    3.
    O use me, Lord, use even me,
    Just as Thou wilt, and when, and where;
    Until Thy blessed face I see,
    Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.
 
 

## 837.  Trust His Care
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tLYsODyN01bn9jCEkEYCr7QJQWMf7fbT/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How gentle God's commands!
    How kind his precepts are!
    Come, cast your burdens on the Lord,
    And trust his constant care.

    2.
    Beneath his watchful eye
    His saints securely dwell;
    That hand which bears all nature up
    Shall guard his children well.

    3.
    Why should this anxious load
    Press down your weary mind?
    Haste to your heav'nly Father's throne,
    And sweet refreshment find.

    4.
    His goodness stands approved
    Thro' each succeeding day:
    I'll drop my burden at his feet,
    And bear a song away.

    1.
    Spirit of truth and might,
    'Tis Thou alone canst teach
    Both young and old to use aright
    The wondrous power of speech.

    2.
    The tongue can no man tame;
    It is a deadly ill;
    And hence Thy gracious aid we claim,
    To bend it to Thy will.

    3.
    May all our words below
    Be prompted by Thy love,
    Till we are called to hear and know
    The speech of saints above.

    1.
    Now the day is over,
    Night is drawing nigh,
    Shadows of the evening
    Steal across the sky.

    2.
    Father, give the weary
    Calm and sweet repose,
    With thy tend'rest blessing
    May our eye-lids close.

    Watching round my bed.  Amen.

    Till morning light appears.  Amen.
 
 

## 842.  A Stranger Here
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u_0tS8QnP3XQgT9vFbJd6Gz0k5z%2DbPDs/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I'm but a stranger here,
    Heav'n is my home;
    Earth is a desert drear,
    Heav'n is my home;
    Danger and sorrow stand 
    Round me on ev'ry hand,
    Heav'n is my Fatherland,
    Heav'n is my home.

    2.
    What though the tempest rage,
    Heaven is my home;
    Short is my pilgrimage,
    Heaven is my home.
    Time's cold and wintry blast
    Soon will be overpast;
    I shall reach home at last;
    Heaven is my home.

    3.
    There at my Saviour's side,
    Heaven is my home,
    I shall be glorified,
    Heaven is my home.
    There'll be the good and blest,
    Those I love most and best;
    There, too, I soon shall rest;
    Heaven is my home.

    1.
    O land of rest, for thee I sigh;
    When will the moment come
    When I shall lay my armor by, 
    And dwell with Christ at home?

    Chorus:
    We'll work till Jesus comes,
    We'll work till Jesus comes,
    We'll work till Jesus comes,
    And we'll be gathered home.

    2.
    No tranquil joys on earth I know,
    No peace, shelt'ring dome;
    This world's a wilderness of woe,
    This world is not my home.

    3.
    When by affliction sharply tried,
    Faith tells of scenes to come,
    Those endless joys prepared above,
    And then I sigh for home.

    1.
    Thou coming One, our wants relieve
    In this our evil day;
    To all thy tempted followers give
    The pow'r to watch and pray.
    Long as our fiery trials last, 
    Long as the cross we bear,
    O may our souls on thee be cast,
    In all-prevailing pray'r.

    2.
    The pow'r of interceding grace
    Give us in faith to claim;
    To wrestle till we see thy face,
    And know thy hidden name.
    Till then thy perfect love impart;
    Till thou appear below
    Be this the cry of ev'ry heart,
    "I will not let thee go."

    3.
    I will not let thee go, unless
    Thou tell thy name to me;
    With all thy great salvation bless,
    And make me all like thee.
    Then shall I on the mountain-top 
    Behold thy open face,
    Where faith in sight is swallowed up,
    And prayer in joyful praise.
 
 

## 845.  'How Far From Home?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zflBVIRovrgAxwZIscwLZUqWqbJZ90n3/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    How far from home?  I asked, as on
    I bent my steps--the watchman spake:
    "The long, dark night is almost gone,
    The morning soon will break.
    Then weep no more, but speed thy flight,
    With Hope's bright star thy guiding ray,
    Till thou shalt reach the realms of light,
    In everlasting day."

    2.
    I asked the warrior on the field:
    This was his soul-inspiring song:
    "With courage, bold, the sword I'll wield,
    The battle is not long.
    Then weep no more, but well endure
    The conflict, till thy work is done;
    For this we know, the prize is sure,
    When victory is won."

    3.
    I asked again; earth, sea, and sun
    Seemed, with one voice, to make reply:
    "Time's wasting sands are nearly run,
    Eternity is nigh.
    Then weep no more--with warning tones
    Portentious signs are thick'ning round,
    The whole creation, waiting, groans, 
    To hear the trumpet sound."

    4.
    Not far from home!  O blessed thought!
    The trav'ler's lonely heart to cheer;
    Which oft a healing balm has brought,
    And dried the mourner's tear.
    Then weep no more, since we shall meet
    Where weary footsteps never roam
    Or trials past, our joys complete,
    Safe in our Father's home.
 
 

## 846.  Asleep in Jesus
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19tFEutDzQNOXfivtmoSxGPptwUQraGBK/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Asleep in Jesus!  blessed sleep
    From which none ever wake to weep;
    A calm and undisturbed repose,
    Unbroken by the last of foes.

    2.
    Asleep in Jesus!  O how sweet
    To be for such a slumber meet!
    With holy confidence to rest
    In hope of being ever blest.

    3.
    Asleep in Jesus!  Peaceful rest,
    Whose waking is supremely blest;
    No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour
    That manifests the Saviour's pow'r.

    4.
    Asleep in Jesus!  Soon to rise,
    When the last trump shall read the skies;
    Then burst the fetters of the tomb,
    And wake in full, immortal bloom.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ROir_0fJofAEzUt5J9pbfzCcp%2DVwZSj6/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    A thrilling cry--we hear the sound;
    The faithful watchmen lift their voice;
    From land to land the world around
    It bids the saints rejoice;
    Ye pilgrims, rise, break forth and sing
    The glorious coming of your King;
    The thrilling cry--we hear it sound,
    "Prepare to meet your Lord."

    2.
    Blow, watchmen, blow the certain sound,
    For dark and dangerous in the night;
    And daring scoffers gather round
    The evil servants smite.
    Ye faithful ones, the strict watch keep.
    With lamps well trimmed, and do not sleep
    The thrilling cry--we hear it sound,
    "Prepare to meet your Lord."

    3.
    In earth's dark hour God's word gives light,
    Its rays dispel the thickening gloom;
    The path to glory now is bright
    The Bridegroom soon will come.
    Then lift your voices, saints, and sing
    Your sweetest strains to Zion's King
    The thrilling cry--we hear it sound,
    "Prepare to meet your Lord."

    With the toilsome journey done,
    And the glorious battle won,
    We shall shine forth as the sun, 
    By and by, by and by.

    2.
    We shall strike the harps of glory,
    By and by, by and by;
    We shall sing redemption's story, 
    By and by, by and by;
    And the strains forevermore
    Shall resound in sweetness o'er
    Yonder everlasting shore,
    By and by, by and by.

    3.
    We shall see and be like Jesus,
    By and by, by and by;
    Who a crown of life will give us,
    By and by, by and by;
    And the angels who fulfil
    All the mandates of His will
    Shall attend, and love us still,
    By and by, by and by.

    4.
    There our tears shall all cease flowing,
    By and by, by and by;
    And with sweetest rapture knowing,
    By and by, by and by,
    All the loved ones, parted long,
    We with shoutings shall rejoin
    In that land of life and song,
    By and by, by and by.

    When my lifework is ended, and I cross the swelling tide,

    O, the soul thrilling rapture when I view his blessed face,
    And the luster of his kindly beaming eye;
    How my full heart will praise him for the mercy, love, and grace,
    That prepares for me a mansion in the sky.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O, the dear ones departed!  How the tender mem'ries come,
     As the farewell at the river I recall;
    In the sweet vales of Eden we shall meet no more to roam,
    But I long to see my Saviour first of all.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Thro' the gates to the city, in a robe of spotless white,
    He will lead me where no tears shall ever fall;

    But I long to meet my Saviour first of all  [Chorus]

    Above the clouds that veil the blue
    Beyond the stars that glimmer through,
    There is a home unknown to care,
    Its gates ajar invite me there.

    Chorus:
    O home of beauty, free from sorrow!
    O everlasting glad tomorrow!

    2.
    The stream of life with ceaseless flow,
    The holy joy that angels know,
    The golden harp, the song divine,
    The spotless robe Faith calls them mine.  [Chorus]

    3.
    The flow'rs that sleep neath winter's snow.
    The loves ones lost to us below,
    The voices hush'd that used to sing,

    When Jesus comes;
    Oh, how His arms will rest me!

    1.
    The Homeland!  O the Homeland!
    The land of the freeborn!
    There's no night in the Homeland,
    But aye the fadeless morn;
    I'm sighing for the Homeland,
    My heart is aching here;
    There is no pain in the Homeland
    To which I'm drawing near;
    There is no pain in the Homeland
    To which I'm drawing near.

    2.
    My Lord is in the Homeland,
    With angels bright and fair;
    There's no sin in the Homeland,
    And no temptation there;
    The music of the Homeland
    Is ringing in my ears;
    And when I think of the Homeland
    My eyes are filled with tears;
    And when I think of the Homeland
    My eyes are filled with tears.

    3.
    The dwellers in the Homeland
    Are beck'ning me to come,
    Where neither death nor sorrow 
    Invades their holy home;
    O dear, dear native country!
    O rest and peace above!
    Christ bring us all to the Homeland
    Of Thy redeeming love;
    Christ bring us all to the Homeland
    Of Thy redeeming love.

    Left our hearts and homes so drear,
    We shall see more bright and clear,
    Some sweet day, by and by.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Oh, these parting scenes will end,
    Some sweet day, by and by;

    When the mists and clouds have flown,
    We shall know as we are known,
    Some sweet day, by and by.  [Refrain]

    1.
    Our Lord is now rejected,
    And by the world disowned,
    By the many still neglected,
    And by the few enthroned,
    But soon He'll come in glory,
    The hour is drawing nigh,
    For the crowning day is coming by and by.
    Oh, the crowning day is coming, 
    Is coming by and by,
    When our Lord shall come in "power," 
    And "glory" from on high,
    Oh, the glorious night will gladden,
    Each waiting watchful eye,
    In the crowning day that's coming by and by.

    2.
    The heav'ns shall glow with splendor,
    But brighter far than they
    The saints shall shine in glory,
    As Christ shall them array,
    The beauty of the Saviour,
    Shall dazzle ev'ry eye,
    In the crowning day that's coming by and by.
    Oh, the crowning day is coming, 
    Is coming by and by,
    When our Lord shall come in "power,"

    Each waiting watchful eye,
    In the crowning day that's coming by and by.

    3.
    Our pain shall then be over,
    We'll sin and sigh no more,
    Behind us all of sorrow,
    And naught but joy before,
    A joy in our Redeemer,
    As we to Him are nigh,
    In the crowning day that's coming by and by.
    Oh, the crowning day is coming, 
    Is coming by and by,
    When our Lord shall come in "power," 
    And "glory" from on high,
    Oh, the glorious night will gladden,
    Each waiting watchful eye,
    In the crowning day that's coming by and by.

    4.
    Let all that look for, hasten
    The coming joyful day,
    By earnest consecration,
    To walk the narrow way,
    By gath'ring in the lost ones,
    For whom our Lord did die,
    For the crowning day that's coming by and by.
    Oh, the crowning day is coming, 
    Is coming by and by,
    When our Lord shall come in "power," 
    And "glory" from on high,
    Oh, the glorious night will gladden,
    Each waiting watchful eye,
    In the crowning day that's coming by and by.

    They will pass the pearly portal,

    Never weary or alone;
    O, we long for that glad morrow
    When the King shall claim His own.

    1.
    "We would see Jesus;" for the shadows lengthen
    Across the little landscape of our life;
    We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen
    For the last conflict in this mortal strife.

    2.
    "We would see Jesus," Rock of our salvation,
    Whereon our feet were set with sov'reign grace;
    Not life, nor death, with all their agitation,
    Can thence remove us, gazing on his face.

    3.
    "We would see Jesus;" other lights are paling,
    Which for long years we did rejoice to see;
    The blessings of this sinful world are failing;
    We would not mourn them, in exchange for Thee.

    4.
    "We would see Jesus;" this is all we're needing,
    Strength, joy, and willingness come with the sight;
    We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading,
    Soon to return and end this mortal night!

    And they serve Him night and day,

    We shall meet, no more to sever;
    In the bright, the bright forever,
    In the summer land of song.

    2.
    Yet a little while we linger
    Ere we reach our journey's end;
    Yet a little while of labor,
    Ere the ev'ning shades descend;
    Then we'll lay us down to slumber,
    But the night will soon be o'er;
    In the bright, the bright forever,
    We shall wake, to weep no more.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O the bliss of life eternal!
    O the long unbroken rest!
    In the golden fields of pleasure,
    In the region of the blest;
    But, to see our dear Redeemer,
    And before his throne to fall,
    There to hear his gracious welcome,
    Will be sweeter far than all.  [Chorus]

    All the errors of today,
    When the weary watch is over,
    And the mists have cleared away.  [Chorus]

    3.
    When the mists have ris'n above us,
    As our Father knows his own, 
    Face to face with those that love us,
    We shall know as we are known;
    Far beyond the orient meadows 
    Floats the golden fringe of day;
    Heart to heart we bide the shadows,
    Till the mists have cleared away.  [Chorus]
 
 

## 894.  '"Hold Fast Till I Come"'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xFgKzEdAuNydJDJZenzHKCegxmBc5oCF/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Sweet promise is giv'n to all who believe,
    "Behold I come quickly, mine own to receive;
    Hold fast till I come; the danger is great;
    Sleep not as do others; be watchful, and wait,"

    Chorus:
    "Hold fast till I come;" sweet promise of heavn'n,
    "The kingdom restored, to you shall be giv'n."
    "Come, enter my joy, sit down on my throne;
    Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come."

    2.
    We'll "watch unto pray'r" with lamps burning bright;
    He comes to all others a "thief in the night."
    We know he is near, but know not the day,
    As spring shows that summer is not far away.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Yes!  this is our hope, 'tis built on His word,
    The glorious appearing of Jesus, our Lord;
    Of promises all, it stands as the sum:
    "Behold I come quickly, hold fast till I come."  [Chorus]

    1.
    Joy to the world, the Lord will come!
    Let earth receive her King;

    And heav'n and nature sing,
    And heav'n and nature sing,
    And heav'n, and heav'n and nature sing.

    2.
    Joy to the earth, the Lord will reign!
    Let men their songs employ;
    While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains,
    Repeat the sounding joy,
    Repeat the sounding joy,
    Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

    3.
    Soon will he rule the earth with grace,
    And make the nations prove
    The glories of his righteousness,
    And wonders of his love,
    And wonders of his love,
    And won- and wonders of his love.

    1.
    Awake, ye saints, and raise your eyes,
    And raise your voices high;
    Awake, and praise that sov'reign love
    That shows salvation nigh;
    Awake, and praise that sov'reign love
    That shows salvation nigh.

    2.
    Swift on the wings of time it flies;
    Each moment brings it near;
    Then welcome each declining day,
    Welcome each closing year;
    Then welcome each declining day,
    Welcome each closing year.

    3.
    Not many years their round shall run,
    Not many mornings rise,
    Ere all its glories stand revealed
    To our admiring eyes;
    Ere all its glories stand revealed
    To our admiring eyes.

    O Paradise!  O Paradise!

    Who would not seek the happy land
    Where they that love are blest?

    Where loyal hearts and true
    Stand ever in the light,
    All rapture thro' and thro',
    In God's most holy sigh.

## 898.  Jerusalem the Golden
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xr45L7FLMT4zrcwzO5Zfx5yscPCLUQs4/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jerusalem the golden,
    With milk and honey blest,
    Beneath thy contemplation
    Sink heart and voice oppress'd:
    I know not, O I know not
    What holy joy are there;
    What radiancy of glory,
    What bliss beyond compare.

    2.
    There is the throne of David,
    And there, from care releas'd.
    The song of them that triumph,
    The shout of them that feast;
    And they who with their Leader,
    Have conquered in the fight,
    Forever and forever
    Are clad in robes of white.

    3.
    O sweet and blessed country,
    The home of God's elect!
    O sweet and blessed country,
    That eager hearts expect!

    To that dear land of rest;
    Who art with God the Father,
    And Spirit ever blest.
 
 

## 899.  Land of Pure Delight
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xd4Wmq0jr2pPNVncDA8%2Dw5pppB2yZB50/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There is a land of pure delight,
    Where saints immortal reign;
    Infinite day excludes the night,
    And pleasures banish pain.
    There everlasting spring abides,
    And never with'ring flow'rs,
    And but a little space divides
    This heav'nly land from ours.

    2.
    Pure is the land the saints espy,
    And all the region peace;
    No wanton lips nor envious eye
    Can see or taste the bliss.
    Those holy gates forever bar
    Pollution, sin, and shame;
    None shall obtain admittance there
    But foll'wers of the Lamb.

    3.
    O could we make our doubts remove
    Those gloomy doubts that rise,
    And see the Canaan that we love,
    With unbeclouded eyes;
    Could we but climb where Moses stood,
    And view the landscape o'er,
    Not all this world's pretended good
    Could ever charm us more.
 
 

## 900.  Place of Sacred Rest
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xEn2JhQ6jcZsi_t5edQ%2DT_TnwTEUcSaM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There is a place of sacred rest,
    Far, far beyond the skies,
    Where beauty smiles eternally,
    And pleasure never dies;
    My Father's house, my heav'nly home,
    Where many mansions stand,
    Prepared, by hands divine, for all
    Who seek the better land.

    2.
    When tossed upon the waves of life,
    With fear on ev'ry side,
    When fiercely howls the gath'ring storm
    And foams the angry tide,
    Beyond the storm, beyond the gloom,
    Breaks forth the light of morn,
    Bright beaming from my Father's house,
    To cheer the soul forlorn.

    3.
    In that pure home of tearless joy
    Earth's parted friends shall meet,
    With smiles of love that never fade,
    And blessedness complete.
    There, there adieus are sounds unknown;
    Death frowns not on that scene,
    But life and glorious beauty shine,
    Untroubled and serene.

    1.
    Hark!  the song of Jubilee;
    Loud as mighty thunders roar,
    Or the fulness of the sea
    When it breaks upon the shore;
    Hallelujah!  'tis the Lord!
    Lo, he comes on earth to reign;
    Hallelujah!  let the word
    Echo round the earth and main.

    2.
    Hallelujah!  hark!  the sound
    Rises joyful to the skies;
    From above, beneath, around,
    Wake creation's harmonies:
    See Jehovah's banner furl'd,
    Sheath'd his sword:  he speaks, 'tis done;
    Hallelujah!  let the word
    Echo around the earth and main.

    3.
    He shall reign from pole to pole
    With supreme, unbounded sway;
    He shall reign, when like a scroll
    Yonder heav'ns have pass'd away:
    Then beneath his iron rod,
    Man's last enemy shall fall;
    Hallelujah!  to our God,
    Lo, he comes to conquer all.
 
 

## 902.  To Be There
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jWzvA6HJHniF44dffB8deJCR6OlIUJER/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    We speak of the realms of the blest,
    That country so bright and so fair,
    And oft are its glories confess'd,
    But what must it be to be there!
    We speak of its streets of pure gold,
    Its walls deck'd with jewels so rare,
    Its wonders and pleasures untold,
    But what must it be to be there!

    2.
    We speak of its freedom from sin,
    From sorrow, temptation and care,
    From trials without and within,
    But what must it be to be there!
    We speak of its service of love,
    And robes which the glorified wear,
    The church of the firstborn above,
    But what must it be to be there!

    3.
    Do Thee, midst temptation and woe,
    For heaven my spirit prepare,
    And shortly I also shall know
    And feel what it is to be there;
    Then o'er the bright fields we shall roam,
    In glory celestial and fair,
    With saints and with angels at home,
    And Jesus himself will be there.

    1.
    Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning!
    Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain!
    Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mourning:
    Zion, in triumph, begins her mild reign.

    2.
    Lo, in the desert, rich flowers are springing;
    Streams ever copious are gliding along;
    Loud, from the mountaintops, echoes are ringing;
    Wastes rise in verdure, and mingle in song.

    3.
    See, the dead risen from land and from ocean;
    Praise to Jehovah, ascending on high;
    Fall'n are the engines of war and commotion;
    Shouts of salvation are rending the sky.

    1.
    Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness;
    Awake, for thy foes shall oppress thee no more.
    Bright, o'er thy hills, dawns the day star of gladness,
    Arise, for the night of thy sorrow is o'er.

    Chorus:
    Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness;
    Awake, for thy foes shall oppress thee no more.

    2.
     Strong were thy foes; but the arm that subdued them,
    And scattered their legions, was mightier far;
    They fled like the chaff from the scourge that pursued them;
    In vain were their steeds and their chariots of war.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Daughter of Zion, the power that hath saved thee,
    Extolled with the harp and the timbrel shall be;
    Shout:  for the foe is destroyed that enslaved thee;
    Th' oppressor is vanquished, and Zion is free.  [Chorus]

    1.
    On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
    And cast a wishful eye
    To Canaan's fair and happy land,
    Where my possessions lie.

    Chorus:
    We will rest in the fair and happy land,
    Just across on the evergreen shore;
    Sing the song of Moses and the Lamb by and by,
    And dwell with Jesus evermore.

    2.
    O'er all those wide extended plains
    Shines one eternal day,
    There Christ, the Sun, forever reigns,
    And scatters night away.  [Chorus]

    3.
    When shall I reach that happy place,
    And be forever blest?
    When shall I see my Father's face,
    And in his kingdom rest?  [Chorus]

    4.
    Fill'd with delight, my raptured soul
    Would here no longer stay;
    Tho' Jordan's waves around me roll,
    Fearless I'd launch away.  [Chorus]

    1.
    A few more years shall roll,
    A few more seasons come,
    And we shall meet the loved who now
    Are sleeping in the tomb:

    Chorus:
    Then, O my Lord, prepare
    My soul for that great day;
    O, wash me in thy precious blood,
    And take my sins away.

    2.
    A few more storms shall beat
    On this wild, rocky shore,
    And we shall be where tempests cease,
    And surges swell no more:  [Chorus]

    3.
    A few more struggles here,
    A few more partings sore,
    A few more toils, a few more tears,
    And we shall weep no more:  [Chorus]

    4.
    'Tis but a little while,
    And He shall come again,
    Who died that we might live, who lives
    That we may with him reign:  [Chorus]

    1.
    Shall we gather at the river
    Where bright angel feet have trod;
    With its crystal tide forever
    Flowing by the throne of God?

    Chorus:
    Yes, we'll gather at the river,
    The beautiful, the beautiful river;
    Gather with the saints at the river
    That flows by the throne of God.

    2.
    On the margin of the river,
    Washing up its silver spray,
    We will walk and worship ever,
    All the happy golden day.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Ere we reach the shining river,
    Lay we ev'ry burden down;
    Grace our spirits will deliver,
    And provide a robe and crown  [Chorus]

    4.
    Soon we'll reach the shining river,
    Soon our pilgrimage will cease,
    Soon our happy hearts will quiver
    With that melody of peace.  [Chorus]

    1.
    "Forever with the Lord!"
    Amen, so let it be;
    Life for the dead is in that word:
    'Tis immortality.
    Here in this body pent,
    Absent from him I roam;
    Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
    A day's march nearer home.

    Chorus:
    Near home, nearer home,
    A day's march nearer home.

    2.
    My Father's house on high,
    Home of my soul, how near
    At times to faith's aspiring eye,
    Thy golden gates appear!
    Ah, then my spirit faints
    To reach the land I love;
    The bright inheritance of saints,
    Jerusalem above.  [Chorus]

    3.
    And when the morn shall come
    That ends this night of pain,
    Thro' grace may I escape the tomb,
    And life eternal gain;
    Then knowing "as I'm known,"
    How shall I love that word,
    And oft repeat before the throne,
    "Forever with the Lord!"  [Chorus]
 
 

## 909.  Evergreen Shore
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jLl_DtYieZccX27KC0zlGgFtqZpB44Ek/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    We are joyously voyaging over the main,
    Bound for the evergreen shore,
    Whose inhabitants never of sickness complain,
    And never see death any more.

    Chorus:
    Then let the hurricane roar,
    It will the sooner be o'er;
    We will weather the blast, and we'll land at last,
    Safe on the evergreen shore.

    2.
    We have nothing to fear from the wind and the wave,
    Under our Saviour's command;
    And our hearts in the midst of the dangers are brave,
    For Jesus will bring us to land.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Both the wind and the wave our Commander controls,
    Nothing can baffle his skill;
    And his voice when the thundering hurricane rolls,
    Can make the loud tempest be still.  [Chorus]

    4.
    In the thick murky night, when the stars and the moon,
    Send not a glimmering ray,
    Then the light of his countenance, brighter than noon,
    Will drive all our terror away.  [Chorus]

    5.
    Let the high-heaving billows and mountainous wave,
    Fearfully overhead break;
    There is One by our side that can comfort and save,
    There is One who will never forsake.  [Chorus]

    1.
    "Land ahead!"  its fruits are waving
    O'er the hills of fadeless green,
    And the living waters laving
    Shores where heav'nly forms are seen.

    Chorus:
    Rock and storms I'll fear no more,
    When on that eternal shore;
    I am safe within the vail!

    2.
    Onward bark!  the cape I'm rounding;
    See the blessed wave their hands!
    Hear the harps of God resounding
    From the bright immortal band!  [Chorus]

    3.
    Now we're safe from all temptation,
    All the storms of life are past
    Praise the Rock of our salvation,
    We are safe at home at last!  [Chorus]
 
 

## 911.  Glorious Things
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1isF4iHIxFyAo2n0sHeZga5NBP79wvuq%2D/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Glorious things of thee are spoken,
    Zion, city of our God:
    He whose word can not be broken
    Formed thee for His own abode;
    On the Rock of Ages founded,
    What can shake Thy sure repose?
    With salvation's wall surrounded,
    Thou mayst smile at all thy foes.

    2.
    See the streams of living waters
    Springing from eternal love,
    Well supply thy sons and daughters,
    And all fear and want remove;
    Who can faint when such a river
    Ever flows their thirst to assuage?
    Grace, which, like the Lord, the Giver,
    Never fails from age to age.

    3.
    Round each habitation hov'ring,
    See the cloud and fire appear
    For a glory and a cov'ring,
    Showing that the Lord is near;
    Blest inhabitants of Zion,
    Washed in the Redeemer's blood;
    Jesus, whom their souls rely on,
    Makes them kings and priests to God.

    4.
    Saviour, if of Zion's city 
    I, thro' grace, a member am,
    Let the world deride or pity,
    I will glory in Thy name;
    Fading is the worldling's pleasure,
    All his boasted pomp and show;
    Solid joys and lasting treasure
    None but Zion's children know.

    1.
    Who are these like stars appearing,
    These, before God's throne who stand?
    Each a golden crown is wearing,
    Who are all this glorious band?
    Alleluia!  hark, they sing,
    Praising loud their heav'nly King.

    2.
    These are they who have contended
    For their Saviour's honor long,
    Wrestling on till life was ended,
    Foll'wing not the sinful throng:
    Alleluia!  hark, they sing,
    Praising loud their heav'nly King.

    3.
    These are they whose hearts were riven,
    Sore with woe and anguish tried,
    Who in pray'r full oft have striven
    With the God they glorified:  
    Alleluia!  hark, they sing, 
    Praising loud their heav'nly King.
 
 

## 913.  This Same Jesus

    1.
    "This same Jesus!"  O how sweetly
    Fall those words upon the ear,
    Like the swell of far off music,
    In a night watch still and clear,
    He who healed the hopeless leper,
    He who dried the widow's tear,
    He who changed to health and gladness
    Helpless, suff'ring, trembling fear.

    2.
    "This same Jesus!"  When the vision
    Of that last and awful day
    Bursts upon the prostrate spirit,
    Like a midnight lightning ray,
    May we lift our hearts, adoring
    "This same Jesus," loved and known
    As our own most gracious Saviour,
    Seated on the great white throne,

    3.
    He himself, and "not another,"
    He for whom our hearts have yearned
    Thro' long years of twilight waiting,
    To his ransomed ones returned;
    For this word, O Lord, we bless thee,
    Bless our Master's changeless name;
    Yesterday, today, forever, 
    Jesus Christ is still the same.

    Chorus:
    He's coming, coming, coming soon, I know,
    Coming back to this earth again;
    And the weary pilgrims will to glory go,
    When the Saviour comes to reign.

    2.
    The mossy old graves where the pilgrims sleep
    Shall be open'd as wide as before,
    And the millions that sleep in the mighty deep
    Shall live on this earth once more.  [Chorus]

    3.
    There we'll meet ne'er to part in our happy Eden home,
    Sweet songs of redemption we'll sing;
    From the North, from the South, all the ransom'd shall come,
    And worship our heavenly King.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Hallelujah, Amen!  Hallelujah again!
    Soon, if faithful, we all shall be there;
    O, be watchful, be hopeful, be joyful till then,
    And a crown of bright glory we'll wear.  [Chorus]

    1.
    Hark!  hark, my soul!  Angelic songs are swelling
    O'er earth's green fields, and ocean's wave beat shore;
    How sweet the truth those blessed strains are telling
    Of that new life when sin shall be no more.
    Angels of Jesus, Angels of light,
    Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night!  Amen.

    2.
    Onward we go, for still we hear them singing,
    "Come, weary souls, for Jesus bids you come;"

    The music of the gospel leads us home.
    Angels of Jesus, Angels of light,
    Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night!  Amen.

    3.
    Far, far away, like bells at evening pealing,
    The voice of Jesus sounds o'er land and sea,
    And laden souls by thousands meekly stealing,
    King Shepherd, turn their weary steps to Thee.
    Angels of Jesus, Angels of light,
    Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night!  Amen.

    4.
    Rest comes at length:  though life be long and dreary,
    The day must dawn, and dark some night be past;
    Faith's journeys end in welcome to the weary,
    And heav'n, the heart's true home, will come at last.
    Angels of Jesus, Angels of light,
    Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night!  Amen.

    5.
    Angels, sing on!  your faithful watches keeping:
    Sing us sweet fragments of the songs above;
    Till morning's joy shall end the night of weeping,
    And life's long shadows break in cloudless love.
    Angels of Jesus, Angels of light,
    Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night!  Amen.

    1.
    Ten thousand times ten thousand,
    In sparkling raiment bright,
    The armies of the ransomed saints
    Throng up the steeps of light.
    'Tis finished, all is finished,
    Their fight with death and sin:
    Fling open wide the golden gates,
    And let the victors in.

    2.
    What rush of hallelujahs
    Fills all the earth and sky!
    The ringing of a thousand harps
    Proclaims the triumph high.
    O day for which creation
    And all its tribes were made!
    O joy, for all its former woes
    A thousand-fold repaid!

    3.
    O then what raptured, greetings
    On Canaan's happy shore!
    What knitting severed friendship where
    Death partings are no more!
    Then eyes with joy shall sparkle,
    That brimmed with tears of late:
    Orphans no longer fatherless,
    Nor widows desolate.

    4.
    Bring near Thy great salvation,
    Thou Lamb for sinners slain,
    Fill up the roll of Thine elect,
    Then take Thy pow'r and reign;
    Appear, Desire of nations,
    Thine exiles long for home;
    Show in the heav'ns Thy promised sign;
    Thou Prince and Saviour, come!

    The surging harmony:
    One Master, Christ, one Saviour-King;
    And brethren all are we.

    3.
    Sing on, ye heralds of the morn,
    Your grand endeavor strain,
    Till Christian hearts estranged and torn,

    In loving loyalty,
    Shall sing:  One Master, Christ, is ours;
    And brethren all are we.

    4.
    O golden day!  the ages crown,
    Aglow with heavenly love,
    Rare day in prophecy's renown,
    On to thy zenith move,
    When earth and heav'n with one accord,
    In full-voiced unity.
    Shall sing:  One Master, Christ our Lord;
    And brethren all are we.

    Till I fancy but thinly the vail intervenes
    Between the fair city and me.

    3.

    The King of all kingdoms forever, is He,
    And He holdeth our crowns in His hands.

    O, how sweet it will be in that beautiful land,
    So free from all sorrow and pain;

    To meet one another again!
    To meet one another again!
    With songs on our lips and with harps in our hands,
    To meet one another again.

    In seas of heavenly rest,
    And not a wave of trouble roll

    Long, too long, in sin and sadness,
    Far away from thee I pine;
    When, O when shall I the gladness

    To restore me to my home;

    O my Saviour, quickly come!

    Christ is coming!  let creation
    Bid her groans and travails cease;
    Let the glorious proclamation
    Hope restore and faith increase;
    Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!
    Come, thou blessed Prince of Peace!

    2.
    Earth can now but tell the story
    Of thy bitter cross and pain;
    She shall soon behold thy glory,
    When thou comest back to reign;
    Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!
    Let each heart repeat the strain.

    3.
    Long thy exiles have been pining,
    Far from rest, and home, and thee;
    But, in heav'nly vesture shining,
    Soon they shall thy glory see;
    Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!
    Hast the joyous jubilee.

    4.
    With that "blessed hope" before us,
    Let no harp remain unstrung;
    Let the mighty advent chorus
    Onward roll, from tongue to tongue;
    Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!
    Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
 
 

## 937.  'Hark! That Shout!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hahF3m065JOPfpdWK5hByKF1hUY6%2DKwE/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Hark!  that shout of rapture high,
    Bursting forth from yonder cloud;
    Jesus comes, thro' the sky,
    Angels tell their joy aloud,
    Angels tell their joy aloud.

    2.
    Hark!  the trumpet's awful voice
    Sounds abroad o'er sea and land;
    Let his people now rejoice;
    Their redemption is at hand,
    Their redemption is at hand.

    3.
    See, the Lord appears in view;
    Heav'n and earth before him fly;
    Rise, ye saints, he comes for you;
    Rise, to meet him in the sky,
    Rise, to meet him in the sky.

    4.
    Go and dwell with him above,
    Where no foe can e'er molest;
    Happy in the Saviour's love,
    Ever blessing, ever blest,
    Ever blessing, ever blest.
 
 

## 938.  Patience Bids Us Wait
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ha6JDjCaUGhpSxJKbPYI83NVD3DVjyJs/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The glories of that heav'nly land
    I've ofttimes felt before;
    But what I feel is just a taste,
    And makes me long for more,
    And makes me long for more.

    2.
    Had I the pinious of a dove,
    I'd fly and be at rest;
    Then would I go to Christ, my love,
    And dwell among the blest,
    And dwell among the blest.

    3.
    But Patience bids us wait awhile!
    The crown's for them that fight;
    The prize for those that win the race
    By faith, and not by sight,
    By faith, and not by sight.
 
 

## 939.  Redemption Nigh
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hjdUPE8EI5wLGHPauZzgvFdyCtvmz3a6/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    In the sun, and moon, and stars,
    Signs and wonders have appeared;
    Earth has groan'd with bloody wars,
    And the hearts of men have fear'd.

    2.
    Soon shall ocean's hoary deep,
    Tossed with stronger tempests, rise;
    Darker storms the mountains sweep,
    Fiercer lightnings rend the skies.

    3.
    Dread alarms shall shake the proud,
    Pale amazement, restless fear;
    And amid the thunder cloud
    Shall the Judge of men appear.

    4.
    But, tho' from his awful face,
    Heav'n shall fade, and earth shall fly,
    Fear not ye, his chosen race,
    Your redemption draweth nigh.
 
 

## 940.  Rest for the Toiling Hand
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hfau_v_IuitUQAwAb4BmX0v9sMAk3k6L/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Rest for the toiling hand,
    Rest for the anxious brow,
    Rest for the weary, way-worn feet,
    Rest from all labor now.

    2.
    Soon shall the trump of God
    Give out the welcome sound
    That shakes thy silent chamber walls,
    And breaks the turf-sealed ground.

    3.
    'Twas sown in weakness here,
    'Twill then be raised in pow'r;
    That which was sown as earthly seed,
    Shall rise a heav'nly flow'r!
 
 

## 941.  We Would Not Weep
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h5WyChA3Q7%2Dlsxu3w6U8u3iHf8%2DqiM83/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Dear as thou wert, and justly dear,
    We would not weep for thee;
    One thought shall check the starting tear:
    From sorrow thou art free.

    2.
    And thus shall faith's consoling pow'r
    The tears of love restrain:
    O, who that saw thy parting hour
    Could wish thee back again?

    3.
    Angels shall guard thy sleeping dust,
    And, as thy Saviour rose,
    The grave again shall yield her trust,
    And end thy deep repose.
 
 

## 942.  Gone to Rest
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hIUmnlmChg_D8Ew5l1cvYW6We1PewZrf/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    She/He hath passed death's chilling billow,
    And gone to rest;
    Jesus smoothed her/his dying pillow,
    O slumber blest!

    2.
    When the morn of glory, breaking,
    Shall light the tomb,
    Beautiful will be thy waking
    In fadeless bloom;

    3.
    Where no wintry winds are blowing,
    No burial train,
    Crown'd with life's celestial glowing,
    We'll meet again.
 
 

## 943.  No Sorrow There
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h3IvnhjmUuM3iYE5rItFPdNi7yDtcmO3/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There'll be no grief in heav'n;
    For life is one glad day,
    And tears are of those former things
    Which all have passed away.

    Refrain:
    There'll be no sorrow there,
    There'll be no sorrow there;
    In heav'n above, where all is love,
    There'll be no sorrow there.

    2.
    There'll be no sin in heav'n;
    Behold that blessed throng,
    All holy in their spotless robes,
    All holy in their song.  [Refrain]

    3.
    There'll be no death in heav'n;
    For they who gain that shore
    Have won their immortality,
    And they can die no more. [Refrain]
 
 

## 944.  Meet Again
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h1CB7vWX0aipccvATRx8pASOXSyYLWe9/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Meet again when time is o'er,
    Meet again to part no more;
    How it cheers the drooping heart.
    When from friend we're called to part!

    2.
    Meet again where endless joy
    We shall taste without alloy;
    Meet where songs shall ne'er grow old,
    Sweetly tuned to harps of gold.

    3.
    Meet again, how passing sweet,
    Friends long lost again to meet!
    Careworn souls, by temptest driv'n,
    O how sweet to meet in heav'n!
 
 

## 945.  When Thou Shalt Come
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h1LcMNr1AiDjMCmPgaGkRA8zp5AqZEbr/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    When thou, my righteous Judge, shalt come,
    To call thy ransom'd people home,
    Shall I among them stand?
    Shall such a worthless worm as I.
    Who sometimes am afraid to die
    Be found at thy right hand?

    2.
    I love to meet among them now,
    Before thy gracious throne to bow,
    Though weakest of them all;
    Nor can I bear the piercing thought,
    To have my worthless name left out,
    When thou for them shalt call.

    3.
    Let me among thy saints be found,
    When e'er th' Archangel's trump shall sound,
    To see thy smiling face;
    Then joyfully thy praise I'll sing,
    While heaven's resounding mansions ring
    With shouts of endless grace.
 
 

## 946.  Bear Me On
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h1sJqQMUnUlOLHGoFOHeANsPTa0fjwxG/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O how I long to see that day
    When the redeemed shall come
    To Zion, clad in white array
    Their blissful, happy home.

    Chorus:
    O bear me on, bear me on
    To Mount Zion;
    O bear me on to that city of love
    Where saints shall ever dwell.

    2.
    I'll hear the alleluias roll
    From the unnumbered throng,
    And with a heaven-enraptured soul
    I'll join redemption's song.  [Chorus]

    3.
    All hail!  the morn of glory's nigh
    The pilgrim longs to see
    That dries the tear from every eye
    Creation's jubilee.  [Chorus]
 
 

## 947.  My Rest is in Heaven
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gtoLvXymzpxGS1CFJoBXEvbw%2DolUCNO1/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    My rest is in heaven, my rest is not here.
    Then why should I tremble when trials are near?
    Be hush'd, my sad spirit, the worst that can come
    But shortens my journey, and hastens me home.

    2.
    It is not for me to be seeking my bliss,
    Nor building my hopes in a region like this;
    I look for a city that hands have not piled,
    I pant for a country by sin undefiled.

    3.
    Let doubt, then, and danger, my progress oppose,
    They only make heaven more sweet at its close;
    Come joy, or come sorrow, what e'er may befall,
    An hour with my God will make up for them all.
 
 

## 948.  Beyond the Dark Sea
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hAL%2DJWtMBoaepl8ilyaWCymguh7i7i_f/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I'm weary.  I'm fainting; my day's work is done;
    I'm watching and waiting for life's setting sun;
    The shadows are stretching afar o'er the lea:
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.
    The shadows are stretching afar o'er the lea,
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.

    2.
     The cold surging billows that break at my feet,
    Have lost all their terror, their music is sweet;
    My Saviour is stilling the tempest for me:
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.
    The shadows are stretching afar o'er the lea,
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.

    3.
    Come, loving Redeemer, and take to Thy breast
    The heart that is panting and sighing for rest;
    My Saviour, I'm waiting, I'm waiting:
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.
    The shadows are stretching afar o'er the lea,
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.

    4.
     I'll lay my life's burden, O Lord, at Thy feet, 
    Where angels are waiting with love's welcome sweet;
    The portals of glory are open for me:
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.
    The shadows are stretching afar o'er the lea,
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.
 
 

## 949.  No Tears
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gsXg0kfCr7TOHZJoYde9JKmTv2SEg082/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    No tears in yonder home;
    Sorrow can never come;
    Joy echoes thro' the dome;
    Love rules the endless years,
    No tears, No tears in yonder home.

    2.
    No pain in yonder home;
    Sickness has sealed her room;
    Health in immortal bloom
    Fills all the wide domain:
    No pain, No pain in yonder home.

    3.
    No death in yonder home;
    No parting hour of gloom;
    Death lies dead in the tomb,
    Whence rose the dust of Faith:
    No death, No death in yonder home.

    4.
    Clasping again our own,
    Knowing as we are known,
    Walking no more alone,
    Hail sinless Eden years!
    No tears, No tears in yonder home.
