    1.
    Cast thy burden on the Lord,
    Cast thy burden on the Lord.
    Cast thy burden on the Lord,
    And he will sustain thee, and strengthen thee, and comfort thee;
    He still sustain thee, and comfort thee,
    He will sustain thee, and comfort thee.
    He will sustain thee, He will comfort thee;
    Cast thy burden on the Lord,
    Cast thy burden on the Lord.
    He will sustain thee, He will comfort thee,
    Cast thy burden on the Lord,
    Cast thy burden on the Lord.
