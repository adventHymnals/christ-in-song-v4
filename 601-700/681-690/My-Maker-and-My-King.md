    1.
    My Maker and my King,
    To thee my all I owe;
    Thy sov'reign bounty is the spring
    Whence all my blessings flow;
    Thy sov'reign bounty is the spring
    Whence all my blessings flow.

    2.
    The creature of thy hand,
    On thee alone I live;
    My God, thy benefits demand
    More praise than I can give;
    My God, thy benefits demand
    More praise than I can give.

    3.
    Lord, what can I impart
    When all is thine before?
    Thy love demands a thankful heart;
    The gift, alas!  how poor;
    Thy love demands a thankful heart;
    The gift, alas!  how poor.

    4.
    O!  let thy grace inspire
    My soul with strength divine;
    Let ev'ry word and each desire
    And all my days be thine;
    Let ev'ry word and each desire
    And all my days be thine.
