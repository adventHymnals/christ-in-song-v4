    1.
    Watchman, blow the gospel trumpet,
    Ev'ry soul a warning give;
    Whosoever hears the message
    May repent, and turn, and live.

    Chorus:
    Blow the trumpet, trusty watchman,
    Blow it loud o'er land and sea;
    God commissions, sound the message!
    Ev'ry captive may be free.

    2.
    Sound it loud o'er ev'ry hilltop,
    Gloomy shade, and sunny plain;
    Ocean depths repeat the message,
    Full salvation's glad refrain.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Sound it in the hedge and highway,
    Earth's dark spots where exiles roam;
    Let it tell all things are ready,
    Father waits to welcome home.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Sound it for the heavy laden,
    Weary, longing to be free.
    Sound a Saviour's invitation,
    Sweetly saying, "Come to me."  [Chorus]
