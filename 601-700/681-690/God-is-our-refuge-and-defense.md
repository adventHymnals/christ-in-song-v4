    1.
    God is our refuge and defense,
    In trouble our unfailing aid;
    Secure in his omnipotence
    What foe can make our souls afraid?

    2.
    Yea, tho' the earth's foundations rock,
    And mountains down the gulf be hurled,
    His people smile amid the shock;
    They look beyond this transient world.

    3.
    Built by the word of his command,
    Ten thousand worlds on nothing rest;
    All living things are in his hand,
    And he who trusts his word is blest.
