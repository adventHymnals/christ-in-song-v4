    1.
    Eternal Father!  strong to save,
    Whose arm doth bind the restless wave,
    Who bidst the mighty ocean deep
    Its own appointed limits keep:
    O hear us when we cry to thee
    For those in peril on the sea!

    2.
    O Saviour!  whose almighty word
    The winds and waves submissive heard,
    Who walkedst on the foaming deep,
    And calm amidst its rage didst sleep:
    O hear us when, etc.

    3.
    O Sacred Spirit!  who didst brood
    Upon the chaos dark and rude,
    Who bad'st its angry tumult cease,
    And gavest light and life and peace:
    O hear us when, etc.
