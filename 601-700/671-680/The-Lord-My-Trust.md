    1.
    The Lord my pasture shall prepare,
    And feed me with a shepherd's care;
    His presence shall my wants supply,
    And guard me with a watchful eye;
    My noonday walks he shall attend,
    And all my midnight hours defend.

    2.
    When on the sultry globe I faint,
    Or, on the thirsty mountain pant,
    To fertile vales and dewy meads
    My weary, wand'ring steps he leads
    Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow,
    Amid the verdant landscape flow.

    3.
    Tho' in the paths of death I tread,
    With gloomy horrors overspread,
    My steadfast heart shall fear no ill,
    For thou, O Lord, art with me still;
    Thy friendly staff shall give me aid,
    And guide me thro' the dreadful shade.

    Amen.
