    1.
    When storms of life are sweeping,
    When lonely watch I'm keeping,
    When floods of ill are falling,
    And tempter voices calling,

    Chorus:  
    Remember me, O Mighty One!
    Remember me, O Mighty One!

    2.
    When walking on life's ocean,
    Control its raging motion;
    When from its dangers shrinking,
    When 'neath the billows sinking.  [Chorus]

    3.
    When weight of care oppresses,
    When thought of sin distresses;
    Through all the life that's mortal,
    And when I pass death's portal.  [Chorus]
