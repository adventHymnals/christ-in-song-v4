    1.
    Answer the call, ye brave men,
    The Master's call to save men;
    Each moment death is gaining,
    Their blood our garments staining:

    Chorus:
    Who'll go?  who'll go, whate'er the cost?
    Who'll go?  who'll go to save the lost?

    2.
    Lighting the world with glory,
    Once more the gospel story
    In purity and pow'r
    Proclaims the judgment hour:  [Chorus]

    3.
    Nations afar are waking,
    Their idol shrines forsaking;
    God's truth puts on its splendor,
    Immanuel its defender:  [Chorus]

    4.
    Bearing the name of Jesus,
    Whose great salvation frees us,
    With joy the good news carry, 
    Nor dare to longer tarry:  [Chorus]

    5.
    Where icy winds are crying,
    Where India's poor are dying,
    Where Southern seas are sleeping,
    Where Western isles are weeping.  

    Chorus:  I go, I go, whate'er the cost;
    I go, I go to save the lost.
