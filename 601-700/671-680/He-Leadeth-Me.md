    1.
    He leadeth me!  O blessed tho't!
    O words with heav'nly comfort fraught!
    Whate'er I do, where'er I be,
    Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

    Chorus:
    He leadeth me, he leadeth me,
    By his own hand he leadeth me:
    His faithful fol'wer I would be,
    For by his hand he leadeth me.

    2.
    Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,
    Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,
    By waters still, o'er troubled sea,
    Still 'tis his hand that leadeth me.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Lord, I would clasp thy hand in mine,
    Nor ever murmur or repine,
    Content whatever lot I see,
    Since 'tis my God that leadeth me.  [Chorus]

    4.
    And when my task on earth is done,
    When by thy grace the vict'ry's won,
    E'en death's cold wave I will not flee,
    Since God thro' Jordan leadeth me.  [Chorus]
