    1.
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer to thee!
    E'en tho' it be a cross
    That raiseth me!
    Still all my song shall be,
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer, my God, to thee, 
    Nearer to thee.

    2.
    Tho' like a wanderer,
    Daylight all gone,
    Darkness be over me,
    My rest a stone;
    Yet in my dreams I'd be
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer to thee.

    3.
    There let the way appear,
    Steps up to heav'n,
    All that thou sendest me,
    In mercy giv'n;
    Angels to beckon me
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer to thee.

    4.
    Then, with my waking tho'ts
    Bright with thy praise,
    Out of my stony griefs
    Bethel I'll raise;
    So by my woes to be
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer to thee.

    5.
    Or if, on joyful wing
    Cleaving the sky,
    Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
    Upward I fly,
    Still all my song shall be,
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Nearer, my God, to thee,
    Near to thee.
