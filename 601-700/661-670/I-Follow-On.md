    1.
    Saviour!  I follow on,
    Guided by thee,
    Seeing not yet the hand
    That leadeth me;
    Hushed be my heart, and still,
    Fear I no further ill;
    Only to meet thy will
    My will shall be.

    2.
    Riven the Rock for me,
    Thirst to relieve,
    Manna from heaven falls
    Fresh ev'ry eve;
    Never a want severe
    Causeth mine eye a tear,
    But thou dost whisper near,
    "Only believe!"

    3.
    Often to Marah's brink
    Have I been bro't;
    Shrinking the cup to drink,
    Help I have sought;
    And with the prayer's ascent,
    Jesus the branch hath rent
    Quickly relief hath sent,
    Sweet'ning the draught.

    4.
    Saviour!  I long to walk
    Closer with thee;
    Led by thy guiding hand,
    Ever to be
    Constantly near thy side,
    Quickened and purified,
    Living for him who died
    Freely for me.
