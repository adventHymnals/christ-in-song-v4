    1.
    Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,
    When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;
    Fairer than morning, lovelier than the daylight,
    Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee!

    2.
    Alone with Thee, amid the mystic shadows,
    The solemn hush of nature newly born;
    Alone with Thee, in holy adoration,
    In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.

    3.
    As in the dawning, o'er the waveless ocean,
    The image of the morning star doth rest;
    So in this stillness Thou beholdest only 
    Thine image mirrored in my peaceful breast.

    4.
    When sinks the soul, subdued by toil, to slumber,
    Its closing eye looks up to Thee in pray'r;
    Sweet the repose beneath Thy wings o'ershading,
    But sweeter still, to wake and find Thee there.

    5.
    So shall it be at last, in that bright morning,
    When the soul waketh, and life's shadows flee;
    Oh, in that glad hour, fairer than day dawning,
    Shall rise the glorious tho't, I am with Thee!
