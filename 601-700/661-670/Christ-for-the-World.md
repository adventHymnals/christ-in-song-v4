    1.
    Christ for the world we sing;
    The world to Christ we bring,
    With loving zeal; 
    The poor, and them that mourn,
    The faint and overborne,
    Sin sick and sorrow worn,
    Whom Christ doth heal.

    2.
    Christ for the world we sing;
    The world to Christ we bring,
    With fervent pray'r;
    The wayward and the lost,
    By restless passions toss'd,
    Redeemed at countless cost,
    From dark despair.

    3.
    Christ for the world we sing;
    The world to Christ we bring,
    With joyful song;
    The newborn souls, whose days,
    Reclaimed from error's ways,
    Inspired with hope and praise,
    To Christ belong.
