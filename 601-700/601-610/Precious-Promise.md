    1.
    Precious promise God hath given
    To the weary passer by,
    On the way from earth to heaven,
    "I will guide thee with mine eye."

    Chorus:
    I will guide thee,
    I will guide thee,
    I will guide thee with mine eye;
    On the road from earth to heaven,
    I will guide thee with mine eye.

    2.
    When temptations almost win thee,
    And thy trusted watchers fly,
    Let this promise ring within thee,
    "I will guide thee with mine eye."  [Chorus]

    3.
    When they secret hopes have perished
    In the grave of years gone by,
    Let this promise still be cherished,
    "I will guide thee with mine eye."  [Chorus]

    4.
    When the shades of life are falling,
    And the hour has come to die,
    Hear the trusty Pilot calling,
    "I will guide thee with mine eye."  [Chorus]
