[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17sVCqXP15H62i43bbobxonuD4SDi5Yg4/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God bless our Sabbath school!  Christ superintend it,
    Source of true wisdom, yet ruling by love;
    Our great Example and Shepherd we follow,
    Till Thy fold we shall enter above.

    2.
    Searching Thy holy word, here we assemble,
    Parents and children, the aged and youth,
    Wonderful Counselor, our minds enlighten,
    Thy Holy Spirit revealing Thy truth.

    3.
    Pow'r both to will and do, Lord Thou hast promised,
    Will thou hast giv'n, now the power bestow,
    Vainly we call Thee our Lord and our Master,
    Unless we live out the truth that we know.
