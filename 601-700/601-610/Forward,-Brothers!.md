    1.
    Forward, brothers, forward!
    Battle for the right,
    God Himself is calling,
    Gird you for the fight.
    He will fail you never,
    Help your brave endeavor,
    Make you conquer ever,
    Trusting in His might.

    Chorus:
    Forward, Forward,
    Christian brothers, forward all,
    Forward, Forward,
    Answer God's inspiring call.
    High His banner flinging,
    On with joyful singing,
    Hallelujahs ringing,
    Forward, brothers, all.

    2.
    Forward, brothers, forward!
    Words of life proclaim.
    Unto others render,
    Service in His name.
    For His grace abounding,
    Mercy all surrounding,
    On with songs resounding,
    Ev'ry heart aflame.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Forward, brothers, forward!
    Strong in faith and pray'r,
    On His arms relying,
    His reward we'll share.
    With His banner o'er us,
    We shall be victorious,
    In His Kingdom glorious,
    We the crown shall wear.  [Chorus]
