    1.
    Chide mildly the erring,
    Kind language endears,
    Grief follows the sinful,
    Add not to their tears;
    Avoid with reproaches
    Fresh pain to bestow;
    The heart that is stricken
    Needs never a blow.

    2.
    Chide mildly the erring,
    Jeer not at their fall;
    If strength be but human,
    How feeble were all!
    What marvel that footsteps
    Should wander away,
    When tempests so darken
    Life's wearisome way?

    3.
    Chide mildly the erring,
    Entreat them with care;
    Their natures are mortal,
    They need not despair.
    We all have some frailty,
    We all are unwise;
    The grace which redeems us
    Must come from the skies.
