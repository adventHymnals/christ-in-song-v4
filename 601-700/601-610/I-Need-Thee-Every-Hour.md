    1.
    I need Thee every hour,
    Most gracious Lord;
    No tender voice like Thine
    Can peace afford.

    Refrain:
    I need Thee, O I need Thee!
    Every hour I need Thee;
    O bless me now, my Saviour!
    I come to Thee.

    2.
    I need Thee every hour;
    Stay Thou near by;
    Temptations lose their pow'r
    When Thou art nigh.  [Refrain]

    3.
    I need Thee every hour,
    In joy or pain;
    Come quickly and abide,
    Or life is vain.  [Refrain]

    4.
    I need Thee every hour;
    Teach me Thy will,
    And Thy rich promises
    In me fulfil.  [Refrain]

    5.
    I need Thee every hour,
    Most Holy One;
    O make me Thine indeed,
    Thou blessed Son.  [Refrain]
