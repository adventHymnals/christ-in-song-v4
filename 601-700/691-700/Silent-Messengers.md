    1.
    Go forth on wings of faith and pray'r,
    Ye pages bright with love;
    Tho' mute, the joyful tidings bear,
    Salvation from above.

    Refrain:
    Silent messengers, go ye forth,
    From ocean to ocean, from South to North;
    Seed of the word, it shall not be sown in vain.

    2.
    Go, tell the sinful, careless soul,
    The warning God has giv'n;
    Go, make the wounded spirit whole,
    With healing balm from heav'n.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Go to the rude, the dark, the poor,
    That live estranged from God;
    Bid them the pearl of life secure,
    Bo't with a Saviour's blood.  [Refrain]

    4.
    O Jesus, friend of dying men,
    Thy presence we implore;
    Without thy blessing all is vain;
    Be with us evermore.  [Refrain]
