[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DS%2DzD0pJsbz4KjW0m4pJSmze9z8beRdq/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Speed on Thy truth, Eternal One,
    Thy holy law proclaim,
    Till ev'ry land beneath the sun,
    Has heard Jehovah's name.
    We own, O Lord, Thy sov'reign pow'r,
    And bow before Thy throne,
    To sing Thy glories in this hour,
    Immortal God alone.

    2.
    Thy truth shall stand, unchanging God,
    Long as the ages roll,
    Tho' trampled oft where sin has trod,
    And error chained the soul.
    Arise and shine, ye chosen band,
    Ye patient scattered few;
    No work so high, so deep, so grand,
    Has e'er been given you.

    3.
    We near that hour of calm surcease,
    From sorrow, death, and sin,
    That brings the weary one release,
    And ushers heaven in.
    Awake, arise, arise and shine;
    Proclaim His truth abroad;
    It is thy Saviour's work and thine,
    Thou messenger of God.

    4.
    We sing Thy praise, eternal Lord,
    Thy glorious truth proclaim;
    Thy mandate is a shield and sword,
    Thy word a living flame.
    Long as the promised years shall roll
    Long as eternity
    We'll bow to Thy benign control,
    And worship only Thee.
