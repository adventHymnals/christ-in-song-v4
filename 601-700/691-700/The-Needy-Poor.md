    1.
    O Christian, if the needy poor
    Have e'er unheeded been,
    Beware, lest at thy closed door
    The Saviour stood unseen!
    Let heart and house be open thrown,
    Thy gifts with others share;
    Let holy charity be shown
    To all who need thy care.

    2.
    Then, while thy glance abroad is cast,
    The Lord is by thy side;
    For thro' the open door He passed,
    When they were not denied.
    And ere thy kindly heart could guess
    Who entered by the door,
    His gracious hands were raised to bless
    Thy basket and thy store.

    3.
    And He shall bless thee all life's day,
    With His almighty love;
    And crown thee in eternity
    That waits the just above,
    Where soon the pearly gates of light
    His hand shall open throw
    To all who now with Him unite
    In ministry below.
