    1.
    I will never, never leave thee,
    I will never thee forsake;
    I will guide, and save, and keep thee,
    For my name and mercy's sake;
    Fear no evil, Fear no evil,
    Only all my counsel take.

    2.
    When the storm is raging round thee,
    Call on me in humble pray'r;
    I will fold my arms around me,
    Guard thee with the tend'rest care:
    In the trial, In the trial,
    I will make thy pathway clear.

    3.
    When the sky above is glowing,
    And around thee all is bright,
    Pleasure like a river flowing,
    All things tending to delight;
    I'll be with thee, I'll be with thee,
    I will guide thy steps aright.

    4.
    When thy soul is dark and clouded,
    Fill'd with doubt, and grief and care,
    Thro' the mists by which 'tis shrouded,
    I will make the light appear,
    And the banner, And the banner
    Of my love I will uprear.
