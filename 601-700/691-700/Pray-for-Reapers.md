    1.
    Saints of God, the dawn is bright'ning,
    Tokens of the coming Lord;
    O'er the earth the fields are whit'ning,
    Louder rings the Master's word:
    Pray for reapers, Pray for reapers,
    In the harvest of the Lord.

    2.
    Feebly now they toil in sadness,
    Weeping o'er the waste around,
    Slowly gath'ring grains of gladness,
    While their echoing cries resound:
    Pray that reapers, Pray that reapers,
    In God's harvest may abound.

    3.
    Now, O Lord, ful fill thy pleasure,
    Breathe upon thy chosen band,
    And with pentecostal measure,
    Send forth reapers in our land;
    Faithful reapers, Faithful reapers,
    Gath'ring sheaves for thy right hand.

    4.
    Soon shall end the time of weeping,
    Soon the reaping time will come,
    Heav'n and earth together keeping
    God's eternal harvest home;
    Saints and angels, Saints and angels,
    Shout the world's great harvest home.
