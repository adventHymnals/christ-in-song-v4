    1.
    I've reach'd the land of corn and wine,
    And all its riches fully mine;
    Here shines undim'd one blissful day,
    For all my night has pass'd away.

    Chorus:
    O, Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land,
    As on thy highest mount I stand,
    I look away across the sea,
    Where mansions are prepar'd for me,
    And view the shining glory shore,
    My heav'n, my home forevermore.

    2.
    My Saviour comes and walks with me,
    And sweet communion here have we;
    He gently leads me by the hand,
    For this is heaven's border land.  [Chorus]

    3.
    A sweet perfume upon the breeze
    Is borne from ever vernal trees
    And flow'rs that never fading grow
    Where streams of life forever flow  [Chorus]

    4.
    The zephyrs seem to float to me
    Sweet sounds of heaven's melody,
    As angels with the white-rob'd throng
    Join in the sweet redemption song.  [Chorus]
