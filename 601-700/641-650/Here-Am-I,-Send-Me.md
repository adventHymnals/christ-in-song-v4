    1.
    Hark!  the voice of Jesus calling,
    "Who will go and work to-day?
    Fields are white, the harvest waiting,
    Who will bear the sheaves away?"
    Loud and long the Master calleth,
    Rich reward he offers free;
    Who will answer, gladly saying,
    "Here am I, O Lord, send me?"

    2.
    If you can not cross the ocean
    And the heathen lands explore,
    You can find the heathen nearer,
    You can help them at your door;
    If you can not speak like angels,
    If you can not preach like Paul,
    You can tell the love of Jesus,
    You can say he died for all.

    3.
    If you can not be the watchman,
    Standing high on Zion's wall,
    Pointing out the path to heaven,
    Of'ring life and peace to all,
    With your pray'rs and with your bounties
    You can do what Heav'n demands,
    You can be like faithful Aaron,
    Holding up the prophet's hands.

    4.
    While the souls of men are dying,
    And the Master calls for you,
    Let none hear you idly saying,
    "There is nothing I can do!"
    Gladly take the task he gives you,
    Let his work your pleasure be;
    Answer quickly when he calleth,
    "Here am I, O Lord, send me."
