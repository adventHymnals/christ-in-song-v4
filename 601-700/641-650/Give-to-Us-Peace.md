[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gxTlWOsHU5IHf3iO6DqC36gstALK%2DaT/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God the all-terrible!  King who ordainest,
    Great winds Thy clarions, the lightnings Thy sword;
    Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reigned,
    Give to us peace, O most merciful Lord.

    2.
    God the all-merciful!  earth hath forsaken
    Thy precepts holy, and slighted Thy word;
    Bid not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken;
    Give to us peace, O most merciful Lord.

    3.
    God the all-righteous One!  man hath defied Thee,
    Yet to eternity standeth Thy word;
    Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside Thee;
    Prosper the right, O most merciful Lord.

    4.
    So shall we render Thee thankful devotion,
    For Thy deliv'rance from peril and sword,
    Singing in chorus from ocean to ocean,
    "Thine is the pow'r and the glory, O Lord."
