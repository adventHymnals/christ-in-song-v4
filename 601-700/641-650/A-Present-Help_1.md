    1.
    There is never a day so dreary,
    But God can make it bright;
    And to the soul that trusts him,
    He giveth pure delight;
    There is never a path so hidden,
    But God will show the way,
    If we will seek his guidance,
    And patiently will pray.

    2.
    There is never a cross so heavy,
    But Jesus' hands are there,
    Outstretched in sweet compassion,
    Our burden still to bear;
    There is never a life so darkened,
    So hopeless, so unblest,
    But may be fill'd with gladness,
    In Jesus' peace may rest.

    3.
    There is never a heart so broken,
    But Jesus Christ can heal;
    The heart once pierced on Calv'ry
    Doth for his people feel;
    He will never fulfill his promise,
    His word can never fail;
    God is our help in trouble,
    Our strength when foes assail.
