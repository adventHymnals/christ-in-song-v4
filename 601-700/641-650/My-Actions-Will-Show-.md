[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12zW1%2DBbBOvyXl2tdJCHye3frzDAQ5FXl/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I love thee, I love thee, I love thee, my Lord;
    I love thee my Saviour, I love thee, my God.
    I love thee, I love thee, and that thou dost know;
    But how much I love then my actions will show.

    2.
    I'm happy, I'm happy, O, wondrous account!
    My joys are immortal, I stand on the mount!
    I gaze on my treasure and long to be there,
    With Jesus and angels, and kindred so dear.

    3.
    O Jesus, my Saviour, with thee I am blest,
    My life and salvation, my joy and my rest.
    Thy love be my story, thy name be my song;
    Thy grace shall inspire both my heart and my tongue.

    4.
    O, who's like my Saviour?  he's Salem's bright King;
    He smiles, and he loves me, and helps me to sing.
    I'll praise him, I'll praise him with notes loud and clear,
    While rivers of pleasure my spirit do cheer.
