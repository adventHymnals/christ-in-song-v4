[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14w5bKNru_hR6DdqIJxZx6S%2DzskWT5z07/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I could not do without Thee,
    O Saviour of the lost,
    Whose wondrous love redeemed me,
    At such tremendous cost;
    Thy righteousness, Thy pardon,
    Thy precious blood must be
    My only hope and comfort, 
    My glory and my plea.

    2.
    I could not do without Thee,
    I cannot stand alone,
    I have no strength or goodness,
    No wisdom of my own;
    But Thou, beloved Saviour,
    Art all in all to me,
    And weakness will be power
    If leaning hard on Thee.

    3.
    I could not do without Thee,
    For, oh, the way is long,
    And I am often weary,
    And sigh replaces song:
    How could I do without Thee?
    I do not know the way;
    Thou knowest, and Thou leadest,
    And wilt not let me stray.

    4.
    I could not do without Thee,
    For years are fleeting fast,
    And soon in solemn silence,
    The river must be passed;
    But Thou wilt never leave me,
    And tho' the waves roll high,
    I know Thou wilt be near me,
    And whisper "It is I."  Amen.
