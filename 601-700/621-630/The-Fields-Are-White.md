## 630.  The Fields Are White
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14VxY%2DRJRg6dGha2Te7pJxml8LuvcKTGR/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The fields are all white,
    And the reapers are few,
    We children are willing,
    But what can we do,
    To work for our Lord in His harvest?

    2.
    Our hands are so small,
    And our words are so weak,
    We cannot teach others;
    How then shall we seek
    To work for our Lord in His harvest?

    3.
    We'll work by our pray'rs,
    By the off'rings we bring,
    By small self-denials;
    The least little thing
    May work for our Lord in His harvest,

    4.
    Until, by and by,
    As the years pass at length,
    We too may be reapers,
    And go forth in strength
    To work for our Lord in His harvest.
