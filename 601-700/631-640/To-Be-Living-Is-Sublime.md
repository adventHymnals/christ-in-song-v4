    1.
    We are living, we are dwelling,
    In a grand and awful time,
    In an age on ages telling,
    To be living is sublime.
    Hark!  the waking up of nations,
    Gog and Magog to the fray;
    Hark!  what soundeth?  Is creation
    Groaning for her latter day?

    2.
    Christian, rouse and arm for conflict,
    Nerve thee for the battle field;
    Bear the helmet of salvation,
    And the mighty gospel shield;
    Bind the breastplate firmly on thee,
    Take the Spirit's sword in hand;
    Boldly, fearlessly, go forth then,
    In Jehovah's strength to stand.

    3.
    Wicked spirits gather round thee,
    Legions of those foes to God--
    Principalities most mighty--
    Walk unseen the earth abroad;
    They are gath'ring to the battle,
    Strengthen'd for the last deep strife;
    Christian, arm!  be watchful, ready,
    Struggle manfully for life.
