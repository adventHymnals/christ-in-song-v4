[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11jWP6s3qu5_7jo%2DO_ZDJXMtmry%2Dfty_Q/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Lord, her watch Thy Church is keeping;
    When shall earth Thy rule obey?
    When shall end the night of weeping?
    When shall break the promised day?
    See the whit'ning harvest languish,
    Waiting still the lab'rers' toil;
    Was it vain, Thy Son's deep anguish!
    Shall the strong retain the spoil?

    2.
    Tidings, sent for ev'ry creature,
    Millions yet have never heard;
    Can they hear without a preacher?
    Lord Almighty, give the word;
    Give the word; in ev'ry nation
    Let the gospel trumpet sound,
    Witnessing of Thy salvation
    To the earth's remotest bound.

    3.
    Then the end:  Thy Church completed,
    All Thy chosen gathered in,
    With their King in glory seated,
    Satan bound, and banished sin;
    Gone forever, parting, weeping,
    Hunger, sorrow, death, and pain;
    Lo!  her watch Thy church is keeping,
    Come, Lord Jesus; come to reign.
