    1.
    "Cast thy bread upon the waters,
    Ye who have but scant supply;
    Angel eyes will watch above it;
    You shall find it by and by;
    He who in his righteous balance,
    Doth each human action weigh,
    Will your sacrifice remember,
    Will your loving deeds repay.

    2.
    "Cast thy bread upon the waters;
    Sad and weary, worn with care,
    Wherefore sitting in the shadow?
    Surely you've a crumb to spare.
    Can you not to those around you
    Sing some little song of hope,
    As you look with longing vision
    Thro' faith's mighty telescope?

    3.
    "Cast thy bread upon the waters,"
    Ye who have abundant store;
    It may float on many a billow,
    It may strand on many a shore;
    You may think it lost forever,
    But, as sure as God is true,
    In this life, or in the other,
    It will yet return to you.
