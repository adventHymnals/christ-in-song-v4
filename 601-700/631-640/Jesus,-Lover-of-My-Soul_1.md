    1.
    Jesus, lover of my soul,
    Let me to Thy bosom fly,
    While the billows near me roll,
    While the tempest still is high!
    Hide me, O my Saviour hide,
    Till the storm of life be past;
    Safe into the haven guide;
    Oh, receive my soul at last!

    2.
    Other refuge have I none;
    Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
    Leave, O leave me not alone,
    Still support and comfort me.
    All my trust on Thee is stay'd,
    All my help from Thee I bring;
    Cover my defenceless head
    With the shadow of Thy wing.

    3.
    Thou, O Christ, art all I want,
    More than all in Thee I find;
    Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
    Heal the sick and lead the blind.
    Just and holy is Thy name;
    I am all unrighteousness;
    Vile and full of sin I am,
    Thou art full of truth and grace.

    4.
    Plenteous grace with thee is found,
    Grace to cover all my sin;
    Let the healing streams abound;
    Make and keep me pure within.
    Thou of life the fountain art,
    Freely let me take of Thee;
    Spring Thou up within my heart,
    Rise to all eternity!  Amen.
