    1.
    Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,
    Lead thou me on!
    The night is dark and I am far from home;
    Lead thou me on!
    Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see
    The distant scene; one step's enough for me.

    2.
    I was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou
    Shouldst lead me on;
    I loved to choose and see my path, but now
    Lead thou me on!
    I loved the garish day, and spite of fears,
    Pride ruled my will.  Remember not past years!

    3.
    So long thy power hath blest me, sure it still
    Will lead me on 
    O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till
    The night is gone,
    And with the morn those angel faces smile
    Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.
