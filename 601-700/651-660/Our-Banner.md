    1.
    Brightly gleams our banner,
    Pointing to the sky,
    Waving wand'rers onward,
    To their home on high;
    Journ'ying o'er the desert,
    Gladly thus we pray,
    And with hearts united,
    Take our heav'nward way.

    Chorus:
    Brightly gleams our banner,
    Pointing to the sky,
    Waving wand'rers onward
    To their home on high.

    2.
    Jesus, Lord and Master;
    At Thy sacred feet,
    Here with hearts rejoicing,
    See Thy children meet;
    Often have we left Thee,
    Often gone astray,
    Keep us, mighty Saviour,
    In the narrow way.  [Chorus]

    3.
    All our days direct us
    In the way we go,
    Lead us on victorious,
    Over every foe;
    Bid Thine angels shield us,
    When the storm clouds low'r,
    Pardon Thou, and save us
    In the final hour.  [Chorus]
