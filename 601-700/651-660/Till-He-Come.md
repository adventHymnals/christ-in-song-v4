    1.
    "Till He come!"  O let the words
    Linger on the trembling chords;
    Let the "little while" between,
    In their golden light be seen;
    Let us think how heav'n and home
    Lie beyond that "Till He come!"

    2.
    When the weary ones we love,
    From the cares of earth remove,
    When their words of hope and cheer
    Fall no longer on our ear,
    Hush!  be ev'ry murmur dumb,
    It is only "Till He come!"

    3.
    Clouds and darkness round us press;
    Would we have one sorrow less?
    All the sharpness of the cross,
    All that tells the world is loss,
    Death and darkness and the tomb,
    Pain us only "Till He come!"
