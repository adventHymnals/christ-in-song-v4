[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17%2DDtD%2DD_0NjgNY2mVqzJpPe3xH6SGCid/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jesus, Saviour, pilot me
    Over life's tempestuous sea;
    Unknown waves before me roll,
    Hiding rock and treach'rous shoal;
    Chart and compass came from thee;
    Jesus, Saviour, pilot me.

    2.
    As a mother stills her child,
    Thou canst calm the ocean wild;
    Boist'rous waves obey thy will
    When thou say'st to them, "Be still!"
    Wond'rous Sov'reign of the sea,
    Jesus, Saviour, pilot me.

    3.
    When at last I near the shore,
    And the fearful breakers roar
    'Tween me and the peaceful rest,
    Then, while leaning on thy breast,
    May I hear thee say to me,
    "Fear not, I will pilot thee."
