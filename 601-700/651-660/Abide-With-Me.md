## 655.  Abide With Me
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/172ep3%2DcCqY0COTxt_deuUiAI1_FgSJka/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Abide with me!  Fast falls the eventide;
    The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
    When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
    Help of the helpless, O, abide with me!

    2.
    Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
    Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
    Change and decay in all around I see;
    O thou who changest not, abide with me!

    3.
    Not a brief glance I ask, nor passing word,
    But as thou dwell'st with thy disciples, Lord,
    Familiar, condescending, patient, free,
    Come, not to sojourn, but abide with me!

    4.
    I need thy presence ev'ry passing hour;
    What but thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r.
    Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be?
    Thro' cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me!

    5.
    I fear no foe, with thee at hand to bless;
    Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;
    Where is death's sting?  where, grave, thy victory?
    I triumph still, if thou abide with me.
