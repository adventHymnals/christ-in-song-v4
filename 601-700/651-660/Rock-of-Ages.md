    1.
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me!
    Let me hide myself in thee;
    Let the water and the blood,
    From thy riven side that flowed,
    Be of sin the double cure;
    Save me from its guilt and pow'r.

    2.
    Not the labor of my hands
    Can fulfil thy law's demands;
    Could my zeal no respite know,
    Could my tears forever flow,
    All for sin could not atone;
    Thou must save, and thou alone.

    3.
    Nothing in my hand I bring
    Simply to thy cross I cling;
    Naked, come to thee for dress,
    Helpless, look to thee for grace;
    Foul, I to the Fountain fly,
    Wash me, Saviour, or I die.

    4.
    While I draw this fleeting breath,
    When mine eyes shall close in death,
    When I soar to world's unknown,
    See thee on thy Judgment throne,
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in thee.
