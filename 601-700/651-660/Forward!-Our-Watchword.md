    1.
    Forward!  be our watchword,
    Steps and voices joined;
    Seek the things before us,
    Not a look behind;
    Burns the fiery pillar, 
    At our army's head,
    Who shall dream of shrinking,
    By our Captain led?

    Refrain:
    Forward!  in the conflict,
    Thro' the toil and fight,
    Foes must fall before us,
    God will speed the right.

    2.
    Forward out of error,
    Leave behind the night;
    Forward thro' the darkness,
    Forward into light!
    Glories upon glories
    Hath our God prepared,
    By the souls that love Him
    One day to be shared!  [Refrain]

    3.
    Far o'er yon horizon
    Rise the city towers,
    Where our God abideth;
    That fair home is ours!
    Thither, onward thither,
    In the Spirit's might,
    Lovers of your country,
    Forward into light!  [Refrain]
