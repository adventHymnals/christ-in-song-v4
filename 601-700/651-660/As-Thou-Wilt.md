    1.
    My Jesus, as thou wilt:
    O may thy will be mine!
    Into thy hand of love 
    I would, my all resign.
    Thro' sorrow or thro' joy,
    Conduct me as thine own,
    And help me still to say,
    "My Lord, thy will be done."

    2.
    My Jesus, as thou wilt:
    Tho' seen thro' many a tear,
    Let not my star of hope
    Grow dim or disappear.
    Since thou on earth hast wept
    And sorrowed oft alone,
    If I must weep with thee,
    "My Lord, thy will be done."

    3.
    My Jesus, as thou wilt:
    All shall be well for me;
    Each changing future scene
    I gladly trust with thee.
    Straight to my home above,
    I travel calmly on,
    And sing in life or death,
    "My Lord, thy will be done."
