    1.
    On our way rejoicing,
    As we homeward move,
    Hearken to our praises,
    O thou God of love!
    Is there grief or sadness?
    Thine it cannot be!
    Is our sky beclouded?
    Clouds are not from Thee!

    Refrain:
    On our way rejoicing,
    As we homeward move,
    Hearken to our praises,
    O Thou God of love!

    2.
    If with honest-hearted
    Love for God and man,
    Day by day Thou find us
    Doing what we can;
    Thou who giv'st the seed-time
    Wilt give large increase,
    Crown the head with blessings
    Fill the heart with peace.  [Refrain]

    3.
    On our way rejoicing
    Gladly let us go;
    Conquered hath our leader,
    Vanquished is our foe!
    Christ without, our safety;
    Christ within, our joy;
    Who, if we be faithful,
    Can our hope destroy?  [Refrain]

    4.
    Unto God the Father
    Joyful songs we sing;
    Unto God the Saviour
    Thankful hearts we bring.
    Unto God the Spirit
    Bow we and adore,
    On our way rejoicing
    Now and evermore!  [Refrain]
