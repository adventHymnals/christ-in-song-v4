    1.
    Saviour!  Thy dying love 
    Thou gavest me,
    Nor should I aught withhold, 
    Dear Lord, from Thee;
    In love my soul would bow,
    My heart fulfill its vow,
    Some off'ring bring Thee now,
    Something for Thee.

    2.
    At the blest mercy-seat, 
    Pleading for me,
    My feeble faith looks up, 
    Jesus to Thee;
    Help me the cross to bear,
    Thy wondrous love declare,
    Some song to raise, or pray'r,
    Something for Thee.

    3.
    Give me a faithful heart,
    Likeness to Thee,
    That each departing day 
    henceforth may see;
    Some work of love begun,
    Some deed of kindness done,
    Some wand'rer sought and won,
    Something for Thee.

    4.
    All that I am and have, 
    Thy gifts so free,
    In joy, in grief, thro' life, 
    Dear Lord, for Thee!
    And when Thy face I see, 
    My ransom'd soul shall be,
    Thro' all eternity,
    Something for Thee.
