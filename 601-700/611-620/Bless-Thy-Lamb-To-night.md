    1.
    Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,
    Bless Thy little lamb to-night;
    Thro' the darkness be Thou near me,
    Keep me safe till morning light.

    2.
    All this day Thy hand has led me,
    And I thank Thee for Thy care,
    Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me,
    Listen to my evening pray'r.

    3.
    May my sins be all forgiven,
    Bless the friends I love so well,
    Take us all at last to heaven,
    Happy there with Thee to dwell.
