    1.
    When morning lights the eastern skies,
    Thy mercy, Lord, disclose;
    And let Thy loving kindness rise;
    On Thee my hopes repose.

    Refrain:
    On Thee my hopes repose,
    On Thee my hopes repose,
    And let Thy loving kindness rise;
    On Thee my hopes repose.

    2.
    Teach me the way where I should go;
    I lift my soul to Thee;
    Redeem me from the raging foe;
    To Thee, O Lord, I flee.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Because Thou art my God, I pray,
    Teach me to do Thy will;
    O lead me in the perfect way,
    By Thy good Spirit still.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Revive me, Lord, for Thy great name,
    And for Thy judgment's sake;
    From all my woes, O lord, reclaim,
    My soul from trouble take.  [Refrain]
