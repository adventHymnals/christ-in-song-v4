    1.
    O sometimes the shadows are deep,
    And rough seems the path to the goal;
    And sorrows, how often they sweep
    Like tempests down over the soul!

    Chorus:
    O, then to the Rock let me fly, 
    To the Rock that is higher than I;
    O, then to the Rock let me fly, 
    To the Rock that is higher than I.

    2.
    O sometimes how long seems the day,
    And sometimes how heavy my feet;
    But toiling in life's dusty way,
    The Rock's blessed shadow, how sweet!  [Chorus]

    3.
    O near to the Rock let me keep,
    Or blessings or sorrows prevail;
    Or climbing the mountain way steep,
    Or walking the shadowy vale.  [Chorus]
