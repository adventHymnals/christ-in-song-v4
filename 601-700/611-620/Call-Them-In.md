    1.
    "Call them in", the wretched,
    Sin-stained wand'rers from the field;
    Peace and pardon freely offer;
    Can you weigh their worth with gold;
    "Call them in," the weak the weary,
    Laden with the doom of sin;
    Bid them come and rest in Jesus;
    He is waiting, "Call them in."

    2.
    "Call them in", the Jew, the Gentile;
    Bid the stranger to the feast:
    "Call them in", the rich, the noble,
    From the highest to the least:
    Forth the Father runs to meet them,
    He hath all their sorrows seen;
    Robe, and ring, and royal sandals,
    Wait the lost ones, "Call them in."

    3.
    "Call them in", the mere professors,
    Slumbering, sleeping, on death's brink;
    Naught of life are they possessors,
    Yet of safety vainly think:
    Bring them in, the careless scoffers,
    Pleasure seekers of the earth:
    Tell of God's most gracious offers,
    And of Jesus' priceless worth.

    4.
    "Call them in", the broken-hearted,
    Cowering 'neath the brand of shame;
    Speak love's message low and tender,
    'Twas for sinners Jesus came:
    See, the shadows lengthen round us,
    Soon the day dawn will begin;
    Can you leave them lost and lonely?
    Christ is coming, "Call them in."
