    1.
    All the way my Saviour leads me;
    What have I to ask beside?
    Can I doubt His tender mercy,
    Who thro' life has been my guide?
    Heav'nly peace, divinest comfort,
    Here by faith in Him to dwell!
    For I know whate'er befall me,
    Jesus doeth all things well;
    For I know whate'er befall me,
    Jesus doeth all things well.

    2.
    All the way my Saviour leads me;
    Cheers each winding path I tread;
    Gives me grace for every trial,
    Feeds me with the living bread;
    Tho' my weary steps may falter,
    And my soul athirst may be,
    Gushing from the Rock before me,
    Lo!  a spring of joy I see;
    Gushing from the rock before me,
    Lo!  a spring of joy I see.

    3.
    All the way my Saviour leads me;
    Oh, the fullness of His love!
    Perfect rest to me is promised
    In my Father's house above;
    When I wake to life immortal,
    Wing my flight to realms of day,
    This my song thro' endless ages
    Jesus led me all the way;
    This my song thro' endless ages
    Jesus led me all the way.
