[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kkJPALsiBIynpbD3GvFOxGu5pNKOnzmX/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    With willing hearts we tread
    The path our Saviour trod;
    We love th' example of our Head,
    The glorious Lamb of God.

    2.
    On thee, on thee alone,
    Our hope and faith rely,
    O thou who wilt for sin atone,
    Who didst for sinners died.

    3.
    We trust thy sacrifice,
    To thy dear cross we flee;
    O may we die to sin, and rise
    To life and bliss in thee.
