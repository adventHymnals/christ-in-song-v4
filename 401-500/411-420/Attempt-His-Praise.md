[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1klHBjdyA6YbWB0MZyn5Q3j4WqaqliHaM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Come, O my soul, in sacred lays,
    Attempt thy great Creator's praise;
    But O what tongue can speak his fame!
    What mortal verse declare his name!

    2.
     Enthroned amid the radiant spheres,
    He glory like a garment wears;
    To form a robe of light divine,
    Ten thousand suns around him shine.

    3.
    Raised on devotion's lofty wing,
    Do thou, my soul, his glories sing;
    And let his praise employ thy tongue
    Till list'ning worlds shall join the song.
