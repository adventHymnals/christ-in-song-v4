    1.
    Baptized into our Saviour's death,
    Our souls to sin must die;
    With Christ our Lord we live anew,
    With Christ ascend on high,
    With Christ ascend on high.

    2.
    There by his Father's side he sits,
    Enthroned divinely fair;
    Yet owns himself our Brother still,
    And our forerunner there,
    And our forerunner there.

    3.
    Rise from these earthly trifles, rise
    On wings of faith and love;
    Above, our choicest treasure lies,
    And be our hearts above,
    And be our hearts above.
