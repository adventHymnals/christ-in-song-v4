    1.
    Blest be the tie that binds
    Our hearts in Christian love!
    The fellowship of kindred minds
    Is like to that above.

    2.
    Before our Father's throne
    We pour our ardent pray'rs;
    Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
    Our comforts and our cares.

    3.
    We share our mutual woes,
    Our mutual burdens bear;
    And often for each other flows
    The sympathizing tear.

    4.
    When we asunder part,
    It gives us inward pain;
    But we shall still be joined in heart
    And hope to meet again.
