    1.
    Jesus, these eyes have never seen
    That radiant form of Thine;
    The vail of sense hangs dark between
    Thy blessed face and mine.

    2.
    I see Thee not, I hear Thee not,
    Yet art Thou oft with me;
    And earth has ne'er so dear a spot,
    As where I meet with Thee.

    3.
    Like some bright dream that comes unsought,
    When slumbers o'er me roll,
    Thine image ever fills my tho't,
    And charms my ravished soul.

    4.
    Yet tho' I have not seen, and still
    Must rest in faith alone,
    I love Thee, dearest Lord, and will,
    Unseen, but not known.
