    1.
    "Forbid them not," the Saviour cried,
    "But suffer them to come;"
    Ah, then maternal tears were dried, 
    And unbelief was dumb.

    2.
    Lord, we believe, and we obey;
    We bring them at thy word;
    Be thou our children's strength and stay,
    Their portion and reward.

    3.
    Let not earth's pleasures draw them down;
    Lord, give them strength to rise,
    And thro' thy strong, attractive pow'r,
    At last to gain the prize.
