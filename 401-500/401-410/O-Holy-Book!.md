    1.
    O holy Book of truth divine!
    Eternal as thy Maker's name,
    Eternal as thy Maker's name;
    Thro' countless ages of decline
    Thy glowing truths have stood the same,
    Thy glowing truths have stood the same.

    2.
    The dust of time is on thy page,
    Yet dims no pure and hallow'd tho't,
    Yet dims no pure and hallow'd tho't;
    In ev'ry clime, in ev'ry age
    Have saints thy holy comfort sought,
    Have saints thy holy comfort sought.

    3.
    Thou art the life, the joy, the light,
    The hope of trusting thousands here,
    The hope of trusting thousands here
    Whose faith shall find eternal sight
    Beyond this dreary mortal sphere,
    Beyond this dreary mortal sphere.

    4.
    No other rule by which to live,
    No other faith like thine to save;
    No other faith like thine to save;
    No other hope such peace can give
    When near the cold and silent grave,
    When near the cold and silent grave.

    5.
    O wondrous lamp of promise sweet!
    Thy light illumes the trusting soul;
    Thy light illumes the trusting soul;
    With glory that shall be complete
    When days and years have ceased to roll,
    When days and years have ceased to roll.
