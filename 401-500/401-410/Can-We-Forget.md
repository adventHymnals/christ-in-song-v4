[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g3adEbfIHh1gv0rbVU39FaDLMyR3Iqp4/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jesus, thy love can we forget,
    And never bring to mind
    The grace that paid our hopeless debt,
    And bade us pardon find?

    2.
    Shall we thy life of grief forget,
    Thy fasting and thy pray'r,
    Thy locks with mountain vapors wet,
    To save us from despair?

    3.
    Gethsemane can we forget
    Thy struggling agony
    When night lay dark on Olivet,
    And none to watch with thee?

    4.
    Our sorrows and our sins were laid
    On Thee, alone on thee;
    Thy precious blood our ransom paid
    Thine all the glory be!
