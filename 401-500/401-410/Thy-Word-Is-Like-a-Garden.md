[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7TFVN4CcBGaKbHAyG2Fy3Au55RQe5XD/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Thy Word is like a garden, Lord,
    With flowers bright and fair;
    And ev'ry one who seeks may pluck
    And weave a garland rare.

    2.
    Thy Word is like a deep, deep  mine;
    And jewels rich and rare 
    Are hidden in its mighty depths
    For ev'ry searcher there.

    3.
    O may I love Thy precious Word,
    May I explore the mine,
    May I the fragrant flowers glean,
    Thy graces all divine.
