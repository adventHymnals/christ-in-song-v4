    1.
    O Love that will not let me go,
    I rest my weary soul in Thee;
    I give Thee back the life I owe,
    That in thine ocean depths its flow
    May richer, fuller be!

    2.
    O Light that followest all my way,
    I yield my flick'ring torch to Thee;
    My heart restores its borrowed ray,
    That in Thy sunshine's glow its day
    May brighter, fairer be!

    3.
    O Joy that seekest me thro' pain,
    I cannot close my heart to Thee;
    I trace the rainbow thro' the rain,
    And feel the promise is not vain,
    That morn's shall tearless be!

    4.
    O cross that liftest up my head,
    I dare not ask to hide from thee;
    I lay in dust life's glory dead,
    And from the ground there blossom red,
    Life that shall endless be!
