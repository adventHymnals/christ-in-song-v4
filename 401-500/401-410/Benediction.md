    1.
    The Lord be with us as we bend
    His blessing to receive;
    His gift of peace upon us send,
    Before his courts we leave.

    2.
    The Lord be with us as we walk
    Along our homeward road;
    In silent thought or friendly talk
    Our hearts be still with God.

    3.
    The Lord be with us till the night
    Enfold us all to rest;
    Be he of ev'ry heart the light,
    Of ev'ry home the guest.
