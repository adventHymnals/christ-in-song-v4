    1.
    One thot' I have, my ample creed,
    So deep it is and broad;
    And equal to my ev'ry need,
    It is the tho't of God.

    2.
    Each morn unfolds some fresh surprise,
    I feast at life's full board;
    And rising in my inner skies,
    Shines forth the tho't of God.

    3.
    At night my gladness is my pray'r;
    I drop my daily load,
    And ev'ry care is pillowed there
    Upon the tho't of God.

    4.
    I ask not far before to see,
    But take in trust my road;
    Life, death, and immortality
    Are in my tho't of God
