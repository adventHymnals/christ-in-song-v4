[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i2yIa0DK4JTIYjj4RRJ0OEvrkLZkVJ2%2D/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing,
    Fill out hearts with joy and peace;
    Let us each Thy love possessing,
    Triumph in redeeming grace.
    O refresh us, O refresh us,
    Traveling thro' this wilderness!

    2.
    Thanks we give, and adoration,
    For Thy gospel's joyful sound;
    May the fruits of Thy salvation
    In our hearts and lives abound;
    Ever faithful, ever faithful,
    To Thy truth may we be found.

    3.
    While our days on earth are strengthened,
    May we give them, Lord to Thee;
    Cheered by hope, and daily strengthened,
    May we run, nor weary be.
    Till Thy glory, till Thy glory
    Without clouds in heav'n we see.
