    1.
    Come, let us join our cheerful songs
    With angels round the throne;
    Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,
    But all their joys are one;
    But all their joys are one.

    2.
    Worthy the Lamb who died, they cry,
    To be exalted thus;
    Worthy the Lamb, our hearts reply,
    For he was slain for us;
    For he was slain for us.

    3.
    Jesus is worthy to receive
    Honor and pow'r divine;
    And blessings more than we can give,
    Be, Lord, forever thine;
    Be, Lord, forever thine.
