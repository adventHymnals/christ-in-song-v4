[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hipa4bGqal2YBOwvZjIK9ursvJk%2D9Xh3/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Come, Holy Spirit, calm my mind,
    And fit me to approach my God;
    Remove each vain, each worldly tho't,
    And lead me to thy blest abode.

    2.
    Hast thou imparted to my soul
    A living spark of holy fire?
    O, kindle now the sacred flame;
    Make me to burn with pure desire.

    3.
    A brighter faith and hope impart,
    And let me now my Saviour see;
    O, soothe and cheer my burdened heart,
    And bid my spirit rest in thee.
