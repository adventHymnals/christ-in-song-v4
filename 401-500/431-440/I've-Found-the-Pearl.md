    1.
    I've found the Pearl of greatest price!
    My heart doth sing for joy;
    And sing I must, for Christ is mine!
    He shall my song employ,
    He shall my song employ.

    2.
    Christ is my Prophet, Priest, and King;
    My prophet full of light,
    My great High Priest before the throne,
    My King of heav'nly might,
    My King of heav'nly might.

    3.
    Christ is my peace; he died for me,
    For me he shed his blood;
    And as my wondrous Sacrifice,
    Offered himself to God,
    Offered himself to God.

    4.
    Christ Jesus is my all in all,
    My comfort and my love;
    My life below, and he shall be
    My joy and crown above,
    My joy and crown above.
