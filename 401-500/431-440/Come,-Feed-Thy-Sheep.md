    1.
    Come, dearest Lord, and feed thy sheep,
    On this sweet day of rest;
    O bless this flock, and make this fold
    Enjoy a heav'nly rest,
    Enjoy a heav'nly rest.

    2.
    Welcome and precious to my soul
    Are these sweet days of love,
    But what a Sabbath shall I keep
    When I shall rest above,
    When I shall rest above!

    3.
    O, if my soul, when Christ appears,
    In this sweet frame be found,
    I'll clasp my Saviour in my arms,
    And leave this earthly ground,
    And leave this earthly ground!
