[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hxVSjHP3HH3Gpf7F0Ct1JdhMKfUvLuLt/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Praise to Him by whose kind favor
    Heav'nly truth has reached our ears;
    May its sweet reviving savor
    Fill our hearts and calm our fears.

    2.
    Truth!  how sacred is the treasure!
    Teach us, Lord, its worth to know;
    Vain the hope, and short the pleasure
    Which from other sources flow.

    3.
    What of truth we have been hearing,
    Fix, O Lord, in ev'ry heart;
    In the day of thy appearing
    May we share thy people's part.
