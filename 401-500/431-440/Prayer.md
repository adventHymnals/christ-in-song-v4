[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hqOtTna%2Da5HmkeMgS3W70YyxL%2DwIgycL/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Pray'r is the soul's sincere desire,
    Unuttered or expressed;
    The motion of a hidden fire
    That trembles in the breast.

    2.
    Pray'r is the burden of a sigh,
    The falling of a tear,
    The upward glancing of an eye,
    When none but God is near.

    3.
    Pray'r is the simplest form of speech
    That infant lips can try;
    Pray'r the sublimest strains that reach
    The Majesty on high.
