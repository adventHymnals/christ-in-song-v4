    1.
    All things are thine; no gift have we,
    Lord of all gifts!  to offer thee;
    And hence, with grateful hearts to-day,
    Thine own, before thy feet we lay.

    2.
    Thy will was in the builders' tho't;
    Thy hand unseen amidst us wrought;
    Thro' mortal motive, scheme, and plan,
    Thy wise, eternal purpose ran.

    3.
    No lack thy perfect fulness knew;
    For human needs and longings grew
    This house of prayer this home of rest
    Here may thy saints be often blest.

    4.
    O Father!  deign these walls to bless,
    Make this th' abode of righteousness,
    And let these doors a gateway be
    To lead us from ourselves to thee.
