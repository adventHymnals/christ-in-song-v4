    1.
    This is the day of rest;
    Our failing strength renew;
    On weary brain and troubled breast
    Shed thou thy fresh'ning dew.

    2.
    This is the day of peace;
    Thy peace our spirits fill;
    Bid thou the blasts of discord cease,
    The waves of strife be still.

    3.
    This is the day of pray'r;
    Let earth to heav'n draw near;
    Lift up our hearts to seek there;
    Come down to meet us here.

    4.
    This is the best of days;
    Send forth thy quick'ning breath,
    And wake dead souls to love and praise,
    O Vanquisher of death!
