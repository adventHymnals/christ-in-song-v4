[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hVnFZMgWoM1LvFT4An0ODR0xkNWAhtke/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God of the universe, to thee
    These sacred walls we rear;
    And now, with songs and bended knee,
    Invoke thy presence here.

    2.
    When sad with care, by sin oppressed,
    Here may the burdened soul
    Beneath thy shelt'ring wing find rest;
    Here make the wounded whole.

    3.
    And when the last long Sabbath morn
    Upon the just shall rise,
    May all who own thee here, be borne
    To mansions in the skies.
