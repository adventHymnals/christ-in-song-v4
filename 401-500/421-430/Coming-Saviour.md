    1.
    Coming Saviour, now in faith
    We remember still thy death;
    Thou wast broken thou hast died;
    For us thou wast crucified.

    2.
    While in faith we drink the wine,
    Of thy blood we see the sign;
    Wash us pure from ev'ry stain,
    Thou that comest soon to reign.

    3.
    Lord, we thus remember thee,
    But we long thy face to see
    Long to reach our heav'nly home;
    Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
