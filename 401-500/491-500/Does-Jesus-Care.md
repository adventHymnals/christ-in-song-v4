    1.
    Does Jesus care when my heart is pain'd
    Too deeply for mirth or song;
    As the burdens press,
    And the cares distress,
    And the way grows weary and long?

    Chorus:
    O yes, He cares, I know He cares,
    His heart is touched with my grief;
    When the days are weary,
    The long nights dreary,
    I know my Saviour cares.

    2.
    Does Jesus care when my way is dark
    With a nameless dread and fear?
    As the daylight fades
    Into deep night shades,
    Does He care enough to be near?  [Chorus]

    3.
    Does Jesus care when I've tried and fail'd
    To resist some temptation strong?
    When in my deep grief
    I find no relief,
    Tho' my tears flow all the night long?  [Chorus]

    4.
    Does Jesus care when I've said "good-bye"
    To the dearest on earth to me,
    And my sad heart aches
    'Till it nearly breaks
    Is this aught to Him?  does He see?  [Chorus]
