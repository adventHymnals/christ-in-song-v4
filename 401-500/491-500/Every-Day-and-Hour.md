    1.
    Saviour, more than life to me,
    I am clinging, clinging close to Thee;
    Let Thy precious blood applied,
    Keep me ever, ever near Thy side.

    Refrain:
    Ev'ry day, ev'ry hour,
    Let me feel Thy cleansing pow'r
    May Thy tender love to me 
    Bind me closer, closer, Lord to Thee.

    2.
    Thro' this changing world below,
    Lead me gently, gently as I go,
    Trusting Thee, I cannot stray,
    I can never, never lose my way. [Refrain]

    3.
    I would love Thee more and more,
    Till this fleeting, fleeting life is o'er,
    Till my soul is lost in love 
    In a brighter, brighter world above.  [Refrain]
