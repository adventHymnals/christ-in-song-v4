    1.
    Moment by moment, hour by hour,
    Constantly trusting His keeping pow'r;
    Day by day and week by week,
    Only His praise my tongue shall speak.

    Refrain:
    Moment by moment, Helper is He,
    Moment by monument dwelling in me;
    Gently subduing powers of sin,
    Wonderful Saviour is Christ within.

    2.
    Why for the body anxious thot'? 
    Knowing He careth, sweet is my lot;
    Mine is the asking, His the store,
    Moment by moment, o'er and o'er.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Why should the spirit doubting weep?
    What I've committed, surely He'll keep;
    Mine is the trusting, His the pow'r,
    Moment by moment, hour by hour.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Why for the resting sing or sigh,
    Selfishly seeking mansions on high?
    Earth needeth more of holy love,
    Than all the universe above.  [Refrain]
