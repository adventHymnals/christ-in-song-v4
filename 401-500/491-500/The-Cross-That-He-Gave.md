    1.
    The cross that he gave may be heavy,
    But it ne'er outweighs His grace;
    The storm that I fear may surround me,
    But it ne'er excludes His face.

    Chorus:
    The cross is not greater than His grace,
    The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
    I am satisfied to know
    That with Jesus here below,
    I can conquer ev'ry foe.

    2.
    The thorns in my path are not sharper
    Than composed his crown for me;
    The cup that I drink not more bitter
    Than he drank in Gethsemane.  [Chorus]

    3.
    The light of his love shineth brighter,
    As it falls on paths of woe;
    The toil of my work groweth lighter,
    As I stoop to raise the low.  [Chorus]

    4.
    His will I have joy in fulfilling,
    As I'm walking in his sight;
    My all to the blood I am bringing,
    It alone can keep me right.  [Chorus]
