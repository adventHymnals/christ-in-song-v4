    1.
    Be present at our table, Lord,
    Be here and ev'rywhere adored;
    These mercies bless, and grant that we
    May feast in Paradise with Thee.

    2.
    We thank Thee, Lord, for this our food,
    For life, and health, and ev'ry good:
    Let manna to our souls be giv'n,
    The Bread of Life sent down from heav'n.
