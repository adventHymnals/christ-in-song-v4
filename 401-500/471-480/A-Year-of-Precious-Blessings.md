    1.
    A year of precious blessings,
    And glorious vict'ries won,
    Of earnest work progressing,
    Its onward course has run;
    To Thee, O God, our Refuge,
    Whose goodness crowns our days,
    Within Thy earthly temple
    We lift our souls in praise;
    Within Thy earthly temple
    We lift our souls in praise.

    2.
    Thou Master of assemblies,
    In mighty pow'r descend,
    Behold our glad reunion,
    Conduct it to the end;
    Inspire our hearts with courage,
    And deeper love for Thee,
    That all Thy Name may honor,
    Where'er our field may be;
    That all Thy name may honor,
    Where'er our field may be.

    3.
    O Church of God's Anointed,
    March on the lost to win,
    Lead forth thy ranks victorious
    Against the hosts of sin;
    Till at His throne in glory,
    Where angels prostrate fall,
    One Hallelujah chorus
    Shall crown Him Lord of all;
    One Hallelujah chorus 
    Shall crown Him Lord of all.
