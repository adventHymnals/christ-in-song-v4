    1.
    Rescue the perishing,
    Care for the dying,
    Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
    Weep o'er the erring one,
    Lift up the fallen,
    Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.

    Chorus:
    Rescue the perishing,
    Care for the dying;
    Jesus is merciful,
    Jesus will save.

    2.
    Tho' they are slighting him,
    Still he is waiting,
    Waiting the penitent child to receive.
    Plead with them earnestly,
    Plead with them gently;
    He will forgive if they only believe.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Down in the human heart,
    Crush'd by the tempter,
    Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
    Touched by a loving heart,
    Wakened by kindness,
    Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Rescue the perishing,
    Duty demands it,
    Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
    Back to the narrow way
    Patiently win them;
    Tell the poor wand'rer a Saviour has died.  [Chorus]
