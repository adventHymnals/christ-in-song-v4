    1.
    Brightly beams our Father's mercy,
    From His lighthouse evermore,
    But to us He gives the keeping
    Of the lights along the shore.

    Chorus:
    Let the lower lights be burning!
    Send a gleam across the wave!
    Some poor fainting, struggling seaman
    You may rescue, you may save.

    2.
    Dark the night of sin has settled,
    Loud the angry billows roar;
    Eager eyes are watching, longing,
    For the lights along the shore.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Trim your feeble lamp, my brother
    Some poor sailor tempest tost,
    Trying now to make the harbor,
    In the darkness may be lost.  [Chorus]
