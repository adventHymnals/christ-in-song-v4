[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eVh6Kkv0YTGDUsxAecvqVYibaoI5bajN/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Saved to serve in any station,
    Saved to make his goodness known;
    Saved to sing His great salvation,
    Saved to live for Him alone.

    Chorus:
    Saved to serve; no reserve;
    Saved to wear His yoke alone;
    Work and praise, all my days,
    Here and round His glorious throne.

    2.
    Saved to show by loving kindness
    That His love is full and free;
    Saved to lead from error's blindness
    With a tender sympathy.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Saved to lift my lowest brothers,
    As the Highest lifted me;
    Crucified with Him, that others
    May have immortality.  [Chorus]
