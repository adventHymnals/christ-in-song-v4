[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6jZbQ9woxgJmD1Zm%2D4iegP%2DkUe4ZR88/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I love to tell the story
    Of unseen things above;
    Of Jesus and his glory,
    Of Jesus and his love;
    I love to tell the story,
    Because I know 'tis true,
    It satisfies my longing
    As nothing else can do.

    Chorus:
    I love to tell the story;
    'Twill be my theme in glory
    To tell the old, old story
    Of Jesus and his love.

    2.
    I love to tell the story;
    More wonderful it seems
    Than all the golden fancies
    Of all our golden dreams;
    I love to tell the story,
    It did so much for me,
    And that is just the reason
    I tell it now to thee.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I love to tell the story;
    'Tis pleasant to repeat
    What seems each time I tell it,
    More wonderfully sweet;
    I love to tell the story,
    For some have never heard
    The message of salvation
    From God's own holy word.  [Chorus]

    4.
    I love to tell the story;
    For those who know it best
    Seem hungering and thirsting
    To hear it like the rest;
    And when in scenes of glory
    I sing the new, new song,
    'Twill be the old, old story
    That I have loved so long.  [Chorus]
