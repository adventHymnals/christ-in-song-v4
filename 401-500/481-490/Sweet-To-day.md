[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iwyPBZzAZ0011y3usNvteBIZxzvgEHVc/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I cease to sing of sweet tomorrow,
    With selfish thought to be away;
    There is a holier balm for sorrow,
    I find in Christ a sweet to-day.

    Refrain:
    A risen Christ, a living Saviour,
    Not in the tomb where once he lay.
    Whene'er I tell his loving favor,
    Sweet by and by is ev'ry day.

    2.
    I am so happy when I'm telling
    How great his pow'r, how great his love;
    Were there no praise where God is dwelling,
    It would be pain to live above.  [Refrain]

    3.
    If but to gain a home in glory
    The Saviour trod this earth alone,
    There ne'er had been a gospel story,
    He ne'er had left his royal throne.  [Refrain]

    4.
    His love is life, his love is heaven
    Eternal life, eternal bliss;
    Accept it freely, be forgiven,
    And taste the future world in this.  [Refrain]
