    1.
    Conquering now and still to conquer,
    Rideth a King in His might,
    Leading the host of all the faithful
    Into the midst of the fight;
    See them with courage advancing,
    Clad in their brilliant array;
    Shouting the name of their Leader,
    Hear them exultingly say.

    Chorus:
    Not to the strong is the battle,
    Not to the swift is the race,
    Yet to the true and the faithful
    Vict'ry is promised through grace.

    2.
    Conquering now and still to conquer,
    Who is this wonderful King?
    Whence all the armies which He leadeth,
    While of His glory they sing?
    He is our Lord and Redeemer,
    Saviour and Monarch divine,
    They are the stars that forever
    Bright in His kingdom will shine.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Conquering now and still to conquer,
    Jesus, Thou Ruler of all,
    Thrones and their scepters all shall perish,
    Crowns and their splendor shall fall,
    Yet shall the armies Thou leadest,
    Faithful and true to the last,
    Find in Thy mansions eternal
    Rest when their warfare is past.  [Chorus]
