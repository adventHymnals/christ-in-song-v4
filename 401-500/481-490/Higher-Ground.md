    1.
    I'm pressing on the upward way,
    New heights I'm gaining ev'ry day;
    Still praying as I onward bound,
    "Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."

    Chorus:
    Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
    By faith on heaven's tableland,
    A higher plane than I have found; 
    Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

    2.
    My heart has no desire to stay
    Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
    Tho' some may dwell where these abound,
    My prayer, my aim is higher ground.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I want to live above the world,
    Tho' Satan's darts at me are hurled;
    For faith has caught the joyful sound, 
    The song of saints on higher ground.  [Chorus]

    4.
    I want to scale the utmost height,
    And catch a gleam of glory bright;
    But still I'll pray till heav'n I've found,
    "Lord, lead me on to higher ground."  [Chorus]
