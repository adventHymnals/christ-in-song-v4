    1.
    God bids his people on the earth,
    Before he comes and calls them hence
    To live unknit to home and hearth,
    Like far bound travelers in tents.

    Chorus:
    We'll live in tents until our feet
    Shall reach the land by sin untrod,
    The gate of pearl, the golden street,
    Whose Builder and whose Maker, God.

    2.
    It is his will that we should pass
    Like strangers, sep'rate and aside
    From all the vain and worldly mass
    That crowd the Babylons of pride.  [Chorus]

    3.
    He'd have us rear no stately towers,
    Sink no foundation walls of stone,
    But camp each night a few short hours,
    And ere the morrow's dawn move on.  [Chorus]

    4.
    O brother, whatsoever chain
    Binds us to fleshly lust and strife,
    Here let us rend it in God's name,
    And live, henceforth, the pilgrim life.  [Chorus]
