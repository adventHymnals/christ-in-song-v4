    1.
    Encamped along the hills of light,
    Ye Christian soldiers, rise,
    And press the battle ere the night
    Shall veil the glowing skies;
    Against the foe in vales below,
    Let all our strength be hurled;
    Faith is the victory, we know,
    That overcomes the world.

    Chorus:
    Faith is the victory!
    Faith is the victory;
    Oh, glorious victory,
    That overcomes the world.

    2.
    His banner over us is love,
    Our sword the word of God;
    We tread the road the saints above
    With shouts of triumph trod;
    By faith they, like a whirlwind's breath,
    Swept on o'er ev'ry field;
    The faith by which they conquered Death
    Is still our shining shield.  [Chorus]

    3.
    On ev'ry hand the foe we find
    Drawn up in dread array;
    Let tents of ease be left behind,
    And onward to the fray;
    Salvation's helmet on each head,
    With truth all girt about,
    The earth shall tremble 'neath our tread,
    And echo with our shout.  [Chorus]

    4.
    To him that overcomes the foe,
    White raiment shall be giv'n;
    Before the angels he shall know
    His name confessed in heav'n;
    Then onward from the hills of light,
    Our hearts with love aflame;
    We'll vanquish all the hosts of night,
    In Jesus' conqu'ring name.  [Chorus]
