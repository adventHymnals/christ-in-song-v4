    1.
    Loyalty to the Master, loyalty to the King,
    Loyalty now and ever, cheerfully let us sing;
    Wholly at His commandment let ev'ry soldier be,
    Joyfully serving Jesus, serving with loyalty.

    Chorus:
    Loyal soldiers, let us joyfully march along,
    Forward, forward, with a triumphant song;

    2.
    Loyalty to the Master, letting Him lead the way,
    Glorious is His banner, follow it ev'ry day;
    Into the midst of battle, conquering as we go,
    Victory He has promised over the deadly foe.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Loyalty to the Master, looking to Him alone,
    Turning away from evil, Jesus will keep His own;
    Onward, still onward pressing, seeing the starry prize
    Waiting for all the faithful, meeting beyond the skies.  [Chorus]
