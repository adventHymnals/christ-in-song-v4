    1.
    With rev'rence let the saints appear,
    And bow before the Lord;
    His high commands with rev'rence hear,
    And tremble at his word,
    And tremble at his word.

    2.
    Sing, all ye ransomed of the Lord,
    Your great Deliv'rer sing;
    Ye pilgrims now for Zion bound,
    Be joyful in your King,
    Be joyful in your King.

    3.
    O Jesus, Lord of earth and heav'n,
    Our life and joy, to thee
    Be honor, thanks, and blessing giv'n
    Thro' all eternity,
    Thro' all eternity.
