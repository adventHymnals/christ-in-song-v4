    1.
    Jesus, thou joy of loving hearts!
    Thou fount of life!  thou light of men!
    From the best bliss that earth imparts,
    We turn unfill'd to thee again.

    2.
    We taste thee, O thou Living Bread,
    And long to feast upon thee still;
    We drink of thee, the Fountainhead,
    As thirst our souls from thee to fill.

    3.
    Our restless spirits yearn for thee,
    Where'er our changeful lot is cast;
    Glad, when thy gracious smile we see,
    Blest, when our faith can hold thee fast.

    4.
    O Jesus, ever with us stay;
    Make all our moments calm and bright;
    Chase the dark night of sin away,
    Shed o'er the world thy holy light!
