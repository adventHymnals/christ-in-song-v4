    1.
    Sweetly the holy hymn
    Breaks on the morning air;
    Before the world with smoke is dim,
    We meet to offer prayer.

    2.
    While flow'rs are wet with dews,
    Dew of our souls, descend;
    Ere yet the sun the day renews,
    O Lord, Thy Spirit send.

    3.
    Upon the battlefield,
    Before the fight begins,
    We seek, O Lord, Thy shelt'ring shield,
    To guard us from our sins.

    4.
    On the lone mountain side,
    Before the morning's light,
    The Man of sorrows wept and cried,
    And rose refreshed with might.

    5.
    Oh, hear us then, for we
    Are very weak and frail,
    We make the Saviour's name our plea,
    And surely must prevail.
