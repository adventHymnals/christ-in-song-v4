    1.
    We may not climb the heav'nly steeps,
    To bring the Saviour down;
    In vain we search the lowest deeps,
    For Him no depths can drown.

    2.
    But warm, sweet, tender, even yet
    A present help is He;
    And faith has yet its Olivet,
    And love, its Galilee.

    3.
    The healing of the seamless dress
    Is by our beds of pain;
    We touch Him in life's throng and press,
    And we are whole again.

    4.
    Thro' Him the first fond pray'rs are said,
    Our lips of childhood frame;
    The last low whispers of our dead
    Are burdened with His name.

    5.
    O Lord and Master of us all,
    Whate'er our name or sign,
    We own Thy sway, we bear Thy call,
    We test our lives by Thine!
