[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ezfaVwaBMfM_taFT2EHxaHTZVX1_G2YM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Our blest Redeemer, ere He breathed
    His tender last farewell,
    A Guide, a Comforter, bequeathed
    With us to dwell.

    2.
    He came sweet influence to impart,
    A gracious, willing guest,
    While He can find one humble heart
    Wherein to rest.

    3.
    And His that gentle voice we hear,
    Soft as the breath of ev'n, 
    That checks the wrong, that calms the fear, 
    And speaks of heav'n.

    4.
    And ev'ry virtue we possess,
    And ev'ry vict'ry won,
    And ev'ry tho't of holiness
    Are His alone.

    5.
    Spirit of purity and grace,
    Our weakness, pitying, see;
    O make our hearts Thy dwelling place,
    Till all like Thee.
