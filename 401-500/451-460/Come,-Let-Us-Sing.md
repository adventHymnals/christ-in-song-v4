    1.
    Come, let us sing the song of songs,
    The angels first began the strain,
    The homage which to Christ belongs;
    "Worthy the Lamb, for he was slain!"

    2.
    Slain to redeem us by his blood,
    To cleanse from ev'ry sinful stain,
    And make us kings and priests to God;
    "Worthy the Lamb, for he was slain!"

    3.
    Long as we live, and when we die,
    And while in heav'n with him we reign,
    This song our song of songs shall be;
    "Worthy the Lamb, for he was slain!"
