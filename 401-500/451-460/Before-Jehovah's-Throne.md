[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ekwYlc5LUGMiSILHaZWhbNkAZ0WE8ke5/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Before Jehovah's awful throne,
    Ye nations bow with sacred joy;
    Know that the Lord is God alone;
    He can create, and he destroy.

    2.
    We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,
    High as the heav'ns voices raise;
    And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
    Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.

    3.
    Wide as the world is thy command,
    Vast as eternity thy love;
    Firm as a rock thy truth shall stand,
    When rolling years shall cease to move.
