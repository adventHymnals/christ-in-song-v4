    1.
    How pleasant, how divinely fair,
    O Lord of hosts, thy dwellings are!
    With long desire my spirit faints
    To meet th' assemblies of the saints.

    2.
    Blest are the souls that find a place
    Within the temple of thy grace;
    There they behold thy gentle rays,
    And seek thy face and learn thy praise.

    3.
    Blest are the men whose hearts are set
    To find the way to Zion's gate;
    God is their strength; and thro' the road
    They lean upon their helper, God.
