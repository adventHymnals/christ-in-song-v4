    1.
    God of light and matchless splendor,
    Feeble tho' the praise we bring,
    Let thy Spirit touch and tender
    Ev'ry heart as now we sing.

    2.
    Heav'n above cannot contain thee;
    At thy presence earth would flee;
    And tho' ev'ry sin doth pain thee;
    Still thy mercy spareth me!

    3.
    Grateful praise my tongue shall offer,
    'Neath thy smile or 'neath thy rod;
    Take the humble gift I proffer,
    Heart, and mind, and strength, O God!
