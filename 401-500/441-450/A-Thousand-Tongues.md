    1.
    O for a thousand tongues to sing
    My great Redeemer's praise!
    The glories of my God and King,
    The triumphs of his grace,
    The triumphs of his grace.

    2.
    Jesus, the name that calms our fears,
    That bids our sorrows cease,
    'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
    'Tis life, and health, and peace,
    'Tis life, and health, and peace.

    3.
    He breaks the pow'r of cancelled sin,
    He sets the pris'ner free;
    His blood can make the foulest clean
    His blood avails for me,
    His blood avails for me.

    4.
    He speaks, and list'ning to his voice,
    New life the dead receive;
    The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
    The humble poor believe,
    The humble poor believe.
