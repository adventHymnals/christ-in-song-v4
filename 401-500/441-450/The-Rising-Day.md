    1.
    Once more, my soul, the rising day
    Salutes thy waking eye;
    Once more, my voice, thy tribute, pay
    To Him who rules on high.

    2.
    Night unto night His name repeats,
    The day renews the sound,
    Wide as the heav'ns on which He sits
    To turn the seasons round.

    3.
    O God, may all my hours be thine,
    While I enjoy the light;
    Then shall my sun in smiles decline,
    And bring a peaceful night.
