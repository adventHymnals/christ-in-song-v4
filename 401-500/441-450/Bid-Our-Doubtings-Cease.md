[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dH0908tvIYgNb%2DuDi5jzzyONULCBJheS/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Let thy Spirit, blessed Saviour,
    Come and bid our doubtings cease;
    Come, O come with love and favor,
    Fill us all with joy and peace.

    2.
    Fearful dangers are around us,
    Satan watches to destroy;
    Lord, our foes would fain confound us;
    O for us thy might employ!

    3.
    On thy word our souls are resting;
    Taught by thee, thy name we love;
    Sweetest of all names is Jesus;
    How it doth our spirits move!
