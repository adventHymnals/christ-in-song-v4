[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dvI1nyAkiya7r2oObiBIRN8%2DiDnCnujg/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jesus, the very thought of thee,
    With sweetness fills the breast;
    But sweeter far thy face to see,
    And in thy presence rest.

    2.
    No voice can sing, no heart can frame,
    Nor can the mem'ry find
    A sweeter sound than Jesus' name,
    The Saviour of mankind.

    3.
    O hope of ev'ry contrite heart!
    O joy of all the meek!
    To those who fall, how kind thou art!
    How good to those who seek!
