    1.
    High in the heav'ns, eternal God,
    Thy goodness in full glory shines;
    Thy truth shall break thro' ev'ry cloud
    That vails thy just and wise designs.

    2.
    Forever firm thy justice stands,
    As mountains their foundations keep;
    Wise as the wonders of thy hands,
    Thy judgments are a mighty deep.

    3.
    O God, how excellent thy grace,
    Whence all our hope and comfort spring!
    The sons of Adam, in distress,
    Fly to the shadow of thy wing.
