    1.
    How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
    In a believer's ear!
    It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
    And drives away his fear.

    2.
    It makes the wounded spirit whole,
    And calms the troubled breast;
    'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
    And to the weary, rest.

    3.
    Dear name!  the rock on which I build!
    My shield and hiding place!
    My never-failing treas'ry, filled
    With boundless stores of grace.
