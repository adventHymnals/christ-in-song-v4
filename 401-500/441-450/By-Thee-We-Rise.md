    1.
    Christ is ris'n, our Lord and King,
    Let the whole creation sing;
    Raise your joys and triumphs high;
    Sing, ye heav'ns, let earth reply.

    2.
    Vain the stone, the watch, the seal,
    Christ the mighty, to conceal;
    Death in vain forbids him rise,
    He hath opened paradise.

    3.
    Lead us, Lord, where thou hast led,
    Thou, our High, exalted Head;
    Made like thee, by thee we rise;
    Ours the cross, the grave, the skies.
