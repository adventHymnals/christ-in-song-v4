    Blessed are the poor in spirit:
    for theirs is the kingdom of heav'n.
    Blessed are they that mourn:
    for they shall be comforted.

    Blessed are the meek:
    for they they inherit the earth.
    Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness;
    for they shall be filled.

    Blessed are the merciful:
    for they shall obtain mercy.
    Blessed are the pure in heart: 
    for they shall see God.

    Blessed are the peacemakers:
    for they shall be called God's children.
    Blessed are they which are persecuted
    for righteousness' sake.

    Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and speak all manner of evil against you
    falsely for my sake.
    Rejoice and be exceeding glad,
    your reward is in heav'n.
