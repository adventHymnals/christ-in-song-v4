    1.
    While in sweet communion feeding
    On this earthly bread and wine,
    Saviour, may we see thee bleeding
    On the cross, to make us thine.
    Tho' unseen, Lord, thou art near us,
    With thy still small voice of love;
    Whisper words of peace to cheer us,
    Ev'ry doubt and fear remove.

    2.
    Bring before us all the story
    Of thy life, and death of woe;
    And, with hopes of endless glory,
    Wean our hearts from all below.
    Draw us nearer and still nearer
    To thy pierc'd and bleeding side,
    Till our view of self grows clearer
    In the light of Him who died.
