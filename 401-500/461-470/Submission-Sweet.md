[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jlh2B1hiAge5H0KXLJyJsF9WCrwrEVs_/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Thou who on the cross didst make
    Sacrifice complete for me;
    Thou who didst for my poor sake
    Suffer on the cursed tree;
    Thou didst teach submission sweet,
    Washing the disciples' feet.

    2.
    O my soul!  and shalt thou scorn
    Thus to do as He hath done?
    Thou a wretched, dying worm;
    He the blessed, sinless One!
    Gladly would I wish his feet,
    Bowing in submission sweet.

    3.
    Such a joy may not be mine,
    Thus to prove my love for thee;
    Such a privilege divine
    Thou hast never given me;
    But, in blest submission sweet,
    Kneel I at thy servant's feet.
