[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k%2D7Op3qL9RC4cZ8P%2DLy0WcNo2Pi3yI_c/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    This rite our blest Redeemer gave
    To all in him believing;
    He bids us seek this hallowed grave,
    To his example cleaving.

    Chorus:
    I'll follow now my glorious Lord,
    Whate'er the ties I sever;
    He saves my soul, he's left his word
    To guide me now and ever.

    2.
    For me the cross and shame to bear,
    Dear Saviour, thou wast willing;
    Nor would I shrink thy yoke to wear,
    All righteousness fulfilling.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Jesus to thee we yield our all;
    In thy kind arms enfold us;
    Our hearts are fixed, no fears appall,
    Thy gracious power shall hold us.  [Chorus]
