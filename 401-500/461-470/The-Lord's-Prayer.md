    1.
    Our Father which art in heaven,
    hallowed be Thy name;
    Thy kingdom come; 
    Thy will be done 
    on earth as it is in heaven;

    2.
    Give us this day our daily bread;
    And forgive us our debts,
    as we forgive our debtors;

    3.
    And lead us not into temptation, 
    but deliver us from evil;
    For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, 
    and the glory, forever.  Amen.
