    1.
    O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good;
    for His mercy endureth forever.
    O give thanks unto the God of gods;
    for His mercy endureth forever.  

    2.
    O give thanks to the Lord of lords;
    for His mercy endureth forever,
    To Him who alone doeth great wonders:
    for His mercy endureth forever.

    3.
    To Him that by wisdom made the heavens:
    for His mercy endureth forever,
    To Him that stretched out the earth above the waters;
    for His mercy endureth forever.

    4.
    To Him that made great lights:
    for His mercy endureth forever. 
    The sun to rule by day: the moon and stars to rule by night:
    for His mercy endureth forever. 

    5.
    Who remembered us in our low estate:
    for His mercy endureth forever. 
    And hath redeemed us from our enemies;
    for His mercy endureth forever. 

    6.
    Who giveth food to all flesh:
    for His mercy endureth forever. 
    O give thanks unto the God of heaven:
    for His mercy endureth forever. Amen.
