## 182. HE CALLS THE LAMBS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
See, Israel's gentle shepherd stands,
With all-engaging charms;
Hark, how He calls the tender lambs.
And folds them in His arms!

2.
"Permit them to approach," He cries,
"Nor scorn their humble name;
For 'twas to bless such souls as these,
The Lord of angels came."

3.
We bring them, Lord, in thankful hands,
And yield them up to Thee;
Joyful that we ourselves are Thine,
Thine let our offspring be.
