####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Oh, for a heart to praise my God!
A heart from sin set free,
A heart that always feels Thy blood,
So freely shed for me.

2.
A heart resigned, submissive, meek,
My dear Redeemer's throne,
Where only Christ is heard to speak,
Where Jesus reigns alone.

3.
A heart in ev'ry tho't renewed,
And full of love divine,
Perfect, and right, and pure, and good,
A copy, Lord, of Thine.

4.
Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
Come quickly from above:
Write Thy new name upon my heart,
Thy new, best name of Love.

```
