## 187. CONFORMED TO THEE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
When, my Saviour, shall I be
Perfectly conformed to thee?
Poor and vile in my own eyes,
Only in thy wisdom wise;

2.
Only thee content to know,
Ignorant of all below;
Only guided by thy light,
Only mighty in thy might?

3.
Fully in my life express
All the hights of holiness;
Sweetly let my spirit prove
All the depths of humble love.

```
