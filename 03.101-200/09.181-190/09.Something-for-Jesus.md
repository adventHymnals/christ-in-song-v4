        Christ in Song 189. Something for Jesus. They bro't their gifts to Jesus, And laid them at his feet, And love for this dear Saviour, Made ev'ry off'ring sweet; Good deeds and words of kindness, Help for the poor of earth, And not a gift among them Was tho't of little worth. Chorus: Wouldst bring a gift to Jesus, That he will count most sweet? Say, "Lord, my heart I give thee," And lay it at his feet.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
They bro't their gifts to Jesus,
And laid them at his feet,
And love for this dear Saviour,
Made ev'ry off'ring sweet;
Good deeds and words of kindness,
Help for the poor of earth,
And not a gift among them
Was tho't of little worth.

Chorus:
Wouldst bring a gift to Jesus,
That he will count most sweet?
Say, "Lord, my heart I give thee,"
And lay it at his feet.

2.
Apart from other givers
A poor wayfarer stood;
He saw the gifts they offered,
The poorest counted good,
And he was filled with longing,
A gift, tho' poor, to bring;
Alas!  all empty handed 
He stood before the King.  [Chorus]

3.
"Dear Lord," he cried in sorrow,
"I know how kind thou art,
Take all I have to give thee,
My sinful, wayward heart."
Then Jesus answered softly,
"Count not the gift as small,
Tho' all of them are precious,
Thine is the best of all.  [Chorus]
