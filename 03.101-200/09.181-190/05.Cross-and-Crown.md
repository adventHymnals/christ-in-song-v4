## 185. CROSS AND CROWN
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
And all the world go free?
No, there's a cross for ev'ry one,
And there's a cross for me.

2.
The consecrated cross 'll bear,
Till He shall set me free;
And then go home my crown to wear,
For there's a crown for me.

3.
Upon the crystal pavement, down
At Jesus' pierced feet,
With joy I'll cast my golden crown,
And his dear name repeat.

```
