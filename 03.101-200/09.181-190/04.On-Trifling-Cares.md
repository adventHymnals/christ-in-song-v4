####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Why do we waste on trifling cares
That life which God's compassion spares,
While in the various range of thought,
The one thing needful is forgot?

2.
Shall God invite us from above? 
Shall Jesus urge his dying love?
Shall troubled conscience give us pain?
And all these pleas unite in vain?

3.
Not so our eyes will always view
Those objects which we now pursue;
Not so will heav'n and hell appear,
When death's decisive hour is near.

4.
Almighty God, thy grace impart;
Fix deep conviction on each heart;
Nor let us waste on trifling cares
That life in which thy compassion spares.
