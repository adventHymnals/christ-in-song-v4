####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I bring my sins to Thee,
The sins I cannot count,
That all may cleansed be,
In thy once opened Fount; 
I bring them, Saviour, all to thee;
The burden is too great for me.

2.
I bring my grief to Thee,
The grief I cannot tell;
No words shall needed be,
Thou knowest all so well:
I bring the sorrow laid on me,
O suff'ring Saviour!  all to thee.

3.
My heart to thee I bring,
The heart I cannot read,
A faithless, wand'ring thing,
An evil heart indeed:
I bring it, Saviour, now to thee,
That fix'd and faithful it may be.

4.
My life I bring to thee,
I would not be my own;
O Saviour let me be Thine, ever thine alone
My heart, my life, my all, I bring
To thee, my Saviour and my King.
