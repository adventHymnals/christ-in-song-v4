        Christ in Song 141. Thy Work Alone. Not what these hands have done, Can save this guilty soul; Not what this toiling flesh has borne, Can make my spirit whole. Thy work alone, my Lord, Can ease this weight of sin; Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God, Can give me peace within.

## 141. THY WORK ALONE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Not what these hands have done,
Can save this guilty soul;
Not what this toiling flesh has borne,
Can make my spirit whole.
Thy work alone, my Lord,
Can ease this weight of sin;
Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,
Can give me peace within.

2.
Not what I feel or do,
Can give me peace with God;
Not all my prayers, or sighs, or tears,
Can ease my awful load.
Thy love to me, O God, 
Not mine, O Lord, to thee,
Can rid me of this dark unrest,
And set my spirit free.

3.
No other work save thine,
No meaner blood will do;
No strength, save that which is divine,
Can bear me safely through.
I praise the God of grace,
I trust his love and might.
He calls me his, I call him mine;
My God, my joy, my light.
