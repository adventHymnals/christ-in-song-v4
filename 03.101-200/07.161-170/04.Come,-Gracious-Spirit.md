## 164. COME, GRACIOUS SPIRIT
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Come, gracious Spirit, heavenly Dove,
With light and comfort from above;
Be thou our Guardian, thou our Guide;
O'er all our thoughts and steps preside.

2.
To us the light of truth display,
And make us know and choose thy way;
Plant holy fear in ev'ry heart,
That we from God may ne'er depart.

3.
Lead us to holiness, the road
That we must take to dwell with God:
Lead us to Christ, the living way,
Nor let us from his precepts stray.

4.
Lead us to God, our final rest,
To be with Him forever blest;
Lead us to heav'n, its bliss to share
Fulness of joy forever there!
