## 167. RETURN, O WANDERER!
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Return, O wanderer, return,
And seek thy Father's face;
Those new desires which in thee burn,
Were kindled by his grace.

2.
Return, O wanderer, return;
Thy Saviour bids thee live;
Come to his cross, and, grateful, learn
How freely he'll forgive.

3.
Return, O wanderer, return,
And wipe the falling tear;
Thy Father calls no longer mourn;
'Tis love invites thee near.

```
