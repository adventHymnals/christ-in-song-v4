####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O Jesus!  thou art standing
Outside the fast-closed door,
In lowly patience waiting
To pass the threshold o'er:
We bear the name of Christians,
Thy name and sign we bear:
O, shame, thrice shame upon us!
To keep thee standing there.

2.
O Jesus!  thou art knocking;
And lo!  that hand is scarred,
And thorns thy brow encircle,
And tears thy face have marred;
O, love that passeth knowledge,
So patiently to wait!
O, sin that hath no equal,
So fast to bar the gate!

3.
O Jesus!  thou art pleading
In accents meek and low,
"I died for you, my children,
And will ye treat me so?"
O Lord, with shame and sorrow
We open now the door:
Dear Saviour, quickly enter,
And leave us nevermore!
