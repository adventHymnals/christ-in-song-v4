## 111. ASHAMED OF JESUS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Jesus, and shall it ever be,
A mortal man ashamed of thee?
Ashamed of thee, whom angels praise,
Whose glories shine through endless days?

2.
Ashamed of Jesus!  sooner far
Let evening blush to own a star;
He sheds the beams of light divine
O'er this benighted soul of mine.

3.
Ashamed of Jesus! just as soon
Let midnight be ashamed of noon;
'Twas midnight with my soul till he,
Bright Morning Star, bade darkness flee.

4.
Ashamed of Jesus!  that dear Friend
On whom my hopes of heav'n depend!
No; when I blush, be this my shame,
That I no more revere his name.

5.
Ashamed of Jesus!  yes, I may 
When I've no guilt to wash away;
No tear to wipe, no good to crave,
No fears to quell, no soul to save.

6.
Till then, nor is my boasting vain,
Till then I boast a Saivour slain;
And O, may this my glory be,
That Christ is not ashamed of me!
