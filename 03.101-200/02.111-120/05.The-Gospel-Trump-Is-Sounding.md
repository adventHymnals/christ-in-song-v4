        Christ in Song 115. The Gospel Trump Is Sounding. The gospel trump is sounding The year of jubilee, And grace is all abounding, To set the bondmen free. Forsake your wretched service, Your Master's claims are o'er; Avail yourselves of freedom, Be Satan's slaves no more.

## 115. THE GOSPEL TRUMP IS SOUNDING
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The gospel trump is sounding
The year of jubilee,
And grace is all abounding,
To set the bondmen free.
Forsake your wretched service,
Your Master's claims are o'er;
Avail yourselves of freedom,
Be Satan's slaves no more.

2.
A better Master's calling,
In accents true and kind;
He asks a loving service,
And claims a willing mind.
He offers you salvation,
And points to joys above;
And, longing, waits to make you
The objects of his love.

3.
In living faith accept him,
Give up all else beside;
While grace is loudly calling,
Look to the Crucified.
Return, return, ye captives,
Return unto your home,
The gospel trump is sounding, 
The jubilee is come.

```
