## 113. GOD CALLING YET
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
God calling yet!  shall I not hear?
Earth's pleasures shall I still hold dear?
Shall life's swift passing years all fly,
And still my soul in slumber lie?

2.
God calling yet!  shall I not rise?
Can I his loving voice despise,
And basely his kind care repay?
He calls me still; can I delay?

3.
God calling yet!  and shall he knock,
And I my heart the closer lock?
He still is waiting to receive,
And shall I dare his Spirit grieve?

4.
God calling yet!  and shall I give
No heed, but still in bondage live?
I wait, but he does not forsake:
He calls me still; my heart, awake!

5.
God calling yet!  I cannot stay;
My heart I yield without delay;
Vain world, farewell!  from thee I part;
The voice of God hath reached my heart.
