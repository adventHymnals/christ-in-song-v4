####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
'Tis midnight; and on Olives' brow
The star is dimmed that lately shone;
'Tis midnight; in the garden now
The suff'ring Saviour prays alone.

2.
'Tis midnight; and from all removed,
The Saviour wrestles lone with fears;
E'en that disciple whom he loved
Heeds not his Master's grief and tears.

3.
'Tis midnight; and for others' guilt
The Man of sorrows weeps in blood;
Yet he who hath in anguish knelt,
Is not forsaken by his God.

4.
'Tis midnight; and from other plains
Is borne the song that angels know;
Unheard by mortals are the strains
That sweetly soothe the Saviour's woe.
