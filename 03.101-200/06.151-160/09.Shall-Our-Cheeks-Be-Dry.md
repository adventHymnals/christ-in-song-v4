## 159. SHALL OUR CHEEKS BE DRY?
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Did Christ o'er sinners weep?
And shall our cheeks be dry?
Let floods of penitential grief
Burst forth from ev'ry eye.

2.
The Son of God in tears,
The wond'ring angels see!
Be thou astonished, O my soul!
He shed those tears for thee.

3.
He wept; shall we not weep?
He died; shall we not die?
He rose; shall we not rise from sleep,
To reign with him on high?
