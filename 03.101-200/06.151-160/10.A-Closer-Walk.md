## 160. A CLOSER WALK
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O, for a closer walk with God!
A calm and heav'nly frame,
A light to shine upon the road
That leads me to the Lamb.

2.
Return, O holy Dove!  return,
Sweet Messenger of rest;
I hate the sins that made thee mourn,
And drove thee from my breast.

3.
What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!  
How sweet their mem'ry still!
But they have left an aching void
The world can never fill.

4.
The dearest idol I have known,
Whate'er that idol be,
Help me to tear it from thy throne,
And worship only thee.

```
