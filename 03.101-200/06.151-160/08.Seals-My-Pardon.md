## 158. SEALS MY PARDON
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I saw One hanging on the tree,
In agony and blood,
Who fixed His languid eyes on me,
As near His cross I stood.

2.
O, never till my latest breath
Can I forget that look;
It seemed to charge me with His death,
Tho' not a word He spoke.

3.
A second look He gave, which said, 
"I freely all forgive;
This blood is for thy ransom paid,
I die that thou may'st live."

4.
Thus while His death my sin displays
In all its blackest hue,
Such is the mystery of grace,
It seals my pardon too.
