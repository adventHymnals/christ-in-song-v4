#### Advent Hymnals
## 155. COME,  MY SOUL
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Come, my soul, thy suit prepare!
Jesus loves to answer pray'r;
He himself has bid thee pray,
Therefore will not say thee nay.

2.
With my burden I begin!
Lord, remove this load of sin;
Let thy blood, for sinners spilt,
Set my conscience free from guilt.

3.
Lord, I come to thee for rest,
Take possession of my breast;
There, thy sovereign right maintain,
And without a rival reign.

```
