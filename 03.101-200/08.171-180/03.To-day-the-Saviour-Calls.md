## 173. TO-DAY THE SAVIOUR CALLS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
To-day the Saviour calls;
Ye wand'rers, come;
O ye benighted souls,
Why longer roam?

2.
To-day the Saviour calls;
Oh, hear him now;
Within these sacred walls
To Jesus bow.

3.
To-day the Saviour calls;
For refuge fly;
The storm of justice falls,
And death is nigh.

4.
The Spirit calls to-day;
Yield to his pow'r,
Oh, grieve him not away,
'Tis mercy's hour.
