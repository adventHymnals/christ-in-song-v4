```txt
1.
Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,
Weak and wounded, sick and sore;
Jesus ready stands to save you,
Full of pity, love, and pow'r.

Chorus:
Turn to the Lord, and seek salvation,
Sound the praise of his dear name;
Glory, honor, and salvation,
Christ the Lord is come to reign.

2.
Now ye needy, come and welcome,
God's free bounty glorify;
True belief and true repentance,
Ev'ry grace that brings you nigh.  [Chorus]

3.
Let not conscience make you linger,
Nor of fitness fondly dream;
All the fitness he requireth
Is to feel our need of him.  [Chorus]

4.
Come, ye weary, heavy-laden,
Bruised and mangled by the fall,
If you tarry till you're better,
You will never come at all.  [Chorus]
