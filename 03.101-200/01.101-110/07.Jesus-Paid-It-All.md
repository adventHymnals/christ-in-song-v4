## 107. JESUS PAID IT ALL
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I hear the Saviour say,
"Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in me thine all in all."

Refrain:
Jesus paid it all,
All to him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain:
He washed it white as snow.

2.
Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow'r, and thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots,
And melt the heart of stone.  [Refrain]

3.
Since nothing good have I
Whereby thy grace to claim,
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.  [Refrain]

4.
And when before the throne
I stand in him complete,
I'll lay my trophies down,
All down at Jesus' feet.  [Refrain]
