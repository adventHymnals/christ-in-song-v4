```txt
1.
I hear thy welcome voice,
That calls me, Lord, to thee;
For cleansing in thy precious blood,
That flow'd on Calvary.

Chorus:
I am coming, Lord!
Coming now to thee!
Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood
That flow'd on Calvary.

2.
Tho' coming weak and vile,
Thou dost my strength assure;
Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,
Till spotless all, and pure.  [Chorus]

3.
'Tis Jesus calls me on
To perfect faith and love,
To perfect hope, and peace, and trust,
For earth and heav'n above.  [Chorus]

4.
All hail, atoning blood!
All hail, redeeming grace!
All hail!  the gift of Christ, our Lord,
Our Strength and Righteousness.  [Chorus]
