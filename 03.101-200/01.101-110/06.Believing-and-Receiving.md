## 106. BELIEVING AND RECEIVING
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Sins of years are washed away,
Blackest stains become as snow,
Darkest night is chang'd to-day,
When you to the Fountain go.

2.
Doubts and fears are borne along
On the current's ceaseless flow,
Sorrow changes into song,
When you to the Fountain go.

3.
East and wealth become as dross,
Worthless, earth's delight and show,
All your boast is in the Cross,
When you to the Fountain go.

4.
Selfishness is lost in love,
Love for Him whose love you know,
All your treasure is above,
When you to the Fountain go.

5.
In His service is delight,
Never will you fear the foe,
Armed by King Jehovah's might,
When you to the Fountain go.

```
