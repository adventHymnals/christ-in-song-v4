## 110. THE CLEANSING WAVE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O now I see the crimson wave,
The fountain deep and wide;
Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,
Points to his wounded side.

Refrain:
The cleansing stream I see, I see,
I plunge, and now it cleanseth me!
O praise the Lord!  it cleanseth me,
It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.

2.
I see the new creation rise,
I hear the speaking blood;
It speaks,--polluted nature dies,
Sinks 'neath the cleansing flood.  [Refrain]

3.
I rise to walk in heav'n's own light,
Above the world and sin;
With heart made pure and garments white,
And Christ enthroned within.  [Refrain]

4.
Amazing grace!  'tis heav'n below,
To feel the blood applied,
And Jesus, only Jesus, know,
My Jesus crucified.  [Refrain]

```
