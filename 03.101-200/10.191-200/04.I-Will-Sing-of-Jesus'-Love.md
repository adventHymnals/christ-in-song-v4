#### Advent Hymnals
## 194. I WILL SING OF JESUS' LOVE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I will sing of Jesus' love,
Sing of him who first loved me;
For he left bright worlds above,
And died on Calvary.

Refrain:
I will sing of Jesus' love,
Endless praise my heart shall give;
He has died that I might live,
I will sing his love to me

2.
Ere a tear had dim'd mine eyes,
Jesus' tears for me did flow;
Ere my first faint prayer could rise,
He had prayed in tones of woe.  [Refrain]

3.
O the depths of love divine!
Earth or heav'n can never know
How that sins as dark as mine
Can be made as white as snow.  [Refrain]

4.
Nothing good for him I've done;
How could he such love bestow?
Lord, I own my heart is won;
Help me now my love to show.  [Refrain]
