1.
O, spread the tidings round,
Wherever man is found,
Wherever human hearts 
And human woes abound;
Let ev'ry Christian tongue
Proclaim the joyful sound:
The Comforter has come.

Chorus:  
The Comforter has come,
The Comforter has come!
The Holy Ghost from heav'n,
The Father's promise giv'n;
O, spread the tidings round,
Wherever man is found,
The Comforter has come!

2.
The long, long night is past,
The morning breaks at last;
And hush'd the dreadful wail
And fury of the blast,
As o'er the golden hills
The day advances fast:
The Comforter has come!  [Chorus]

3.
Behold, the King of kings,
With healing in his wings,
To ev'ry captive soul
A full deliv'rance brings;
And thro' the vacant cells
The song of triumph rings:
The Comforter has come!  [Chorus]

4.
O boundless Love divine!
How shall this tongue of mine
To wond'ring mortals tell
The matchless grace divine,
That I, a child of sin,
Should in his image shine!  
The Comforter has come!  [Chorus]

5.
Sing, till the echoes fly
Above the vaulted sky,
And all the saints above
To all below reply,
In strains of endless love,
The song that ne'er will die:
The Comforter has come!  [Chorus]
