1.
Would we be joyful in the Lord?
Then count the riches o'er,
Revealed to faith within His Word,
And note the boundless store.

Chorus:
There is pardon, peace and pow'r,
And purity, and Paradise;
With all of these in Christ for me,
Let joyful songs of praise to Him arise.

2.
For ev'ry sin, by grace divine
A pardon free bestowed;
And with the pardon peace is mine,
The peace in Jesus' blood.  [Chorus]

3.
Of grace to break the pow'r of sin,
He gives a full supply;
The Holy Ghost, the heart within,
From sin doth purify.  [Chorus]

4.
The pow'r to win a soul to God,
The Spirit, too, imparts;
And He, the gift of Christ, our Lord,
Dwells now in all our hearts.  [Chorus]

5.
These blessings we by faith receive,
By simple childlike trust;
In Christ 'tis God's delight to give;
He promised, and He must.  [Chorus]
