#### Advent Hymnals
## 196. TREAD SOFTLY
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Be silent, be silent,
A whisper is heard,
Be silent, and listen,
Oh, treasure each word.

Chorus:
Tread softly, tread softly,
The Master is here;
Tread softly, tread softly,
He bids us draw near.

2.
Be silent, be silent,
For holy this place,
This altar that echoes
The message of grace.  [Chorus]

3.
Be silent, be silent,
Breathe humbly our pray'r,
A foretaste of Eden
This moment we share.  [Chorus]

4.
Be silent, be silent,
His mercy record;
Be silent, be silent,
And wait on the Lord.  [Chorus]

```
