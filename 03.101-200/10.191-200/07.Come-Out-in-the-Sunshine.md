####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Come out in the sunshine!
O gather its wealth!
There's joy in the sunshine,
And beauty and health.
Why stay in the shadow?
Why weep in the gloom?
Come out in the sunshine,
And let your soul bloom.  [Chorus]

2.
A flow'r in the shadow
Will lose its bright hue,
'Twill weary and wither,
And so 'tis with you.
We fade in the shadow
Of thought or of room;
But out in the sunshine
We blossom and bloom.  [Chorus]

3.
Come out in the sunshine!
O hear Love's sweet voice!
And all holy spirits
With you will rejoice.
You'll sing with the angels,
Wherever you go,
You'll gladly tell others
The way out of woe.  [Chorus]

4.
Live out in the sunshine,
Till Jesus appears,
Then share in his glory
Thro' love's endless years.
O dwell in his presence,
Where no shadow mars;
Reflecting his beauty,
You'll shine as the stars.  [Chorus]
