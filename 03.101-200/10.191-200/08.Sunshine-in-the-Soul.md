```txt
1.
There's sunshine in my soul to-day,
More glorious and bright
Than glows in any earthly sky,
For Jesus is my light.

Chorus:
O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,
When the peaceful, happy moments roll;
When Jesus shows his smiling face
There is sunshine in the soul.

2.
There's music in my soul to-day,
A carol to my King,
And Jesus listening, can hear
The songs I cannot sing.  [Chorus]

3.
There's springtime in my soul to-day,
For when the Lord is near,
The dove of peace sings in my heart,
The flow'rs of grace appear.  [Chorus]

4.
There's gladness in my soul to-day,
And hope, and praise, and love,
For blessings which he gives me now,
For joys laid up above.  [Chorus]
