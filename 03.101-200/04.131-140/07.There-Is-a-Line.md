## 137. THERE IS A LINE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
There is a line by us unseen,
That crosses ev'ry path,
The hidden boundary between,
The hidden boundary between
God's patience and his wrath.

2.
O!  where is this mysterious bourne
By which our path is crossed,
Beyond which God himself hath sworn,
Beyond which God himself hath sworn
That he who goes is lost?

3.
How far may we go on in sin?
How long will God forbear?
Where does hope end?  And where begin, 
Where does hope end?  And where begin
The confines of despair?

4.
An answer from the skies is sent:
"Ye that from God depart,
While it is called today, repent,
While it is called today, repent,
And harden not your heart."

```
