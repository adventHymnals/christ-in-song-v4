## 133. THOU ART THE WAY
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Thou art the Way, to thee alone,
From sin and death we flee;
And he who would the Father seek,
Must seek him, Lord, by thee.

2.
Thou art the Truth; thy word alone,
True wisdom can impart;
Thou only canst inform the mind,
And purify the heart.

3.
Thou art the Life; the rending tomb
Proclaims thy conq'ring arm;
And those who put their trust in thee,
Nor death nor hell shall harm.

4.
Thou art the Way, the Truth, the life;
Grant us that way to know,
That truth to keep, that life to win,
Whose joys eternal flow.

```
