        Christ in Song 140. Go to dark Gethsemane. Go to dark Gethsemane, Ye that feel the tempter's power; Your Redeemer's conflict see, Watch with him one bitter hour; Turn not from his griefs away, Learn of Jesus how to pray.

#### Advent Hymnals
## 140. GO TO DARK GETHSEMANE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Go to dark Gethsemane,
Ye that feel the tempter's power;
Your Redeemer's conflict see,
Watch with him one bitter hour;
Turn not from his griefs away,
Learn of Jesus how to pray.

2.
Follow to the judgment-hall;
View the Lord of life arraigned;
See the wormwood and the gall;
See the pangs his soul sustained;
Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;
Learn of him to bear the cross.

3.
Calvary's mournful mountain climb;
There, adoring at his feet,
Mark that miracle of time,
God's own sacrifice complete:
"It is finished!" hear him cry;
Learn of Jesus how to die.

```
