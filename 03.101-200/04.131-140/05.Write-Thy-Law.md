## 135. WRITE THY LAW
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O that the Lord would guide my ways
To keep his statutes still!
O that my God would grant me grace
To know and do his will!

2.
O send thy Spirit down to write
Thy law upon my heart,
Nor let my tongue indulge deceit,
Nor act the liar's part.

3.
From vanity turn off my eyes,
Let no corrupt design
Nor covetous desires arise
Within this soul of mine.

4.
Order my footsteps by thy word,
And make my heart sincere;
Let sin have no dominion, Lord,
But keep my conscience clear.

```
