#### Advent Hymnals
## 138. THE WONDERS OF REDEEMING LOVE 
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The wonders of redeeming love
Our highest thoughts exceed;
The Son of God comes from above,
For sinful man to bleed.

2.
He gives himself, his life, his all,
A sinless sacrifice,
For man he drains the cup of gall,
For man the Maker dies.

3.
And now before his Father's face
His precious blood he pleads;
For those who seek the throne of grace
His love still intercedes.
