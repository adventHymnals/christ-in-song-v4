## 139. CHIEF OF SINNERS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Chief of sinners tho' I be,
Jesus shed his blood for me,
Died that I might live on high,
Died that I might never die;
As the branch is to the vine,
I am his, and he is mine.

2.
O the height of Jesus' love!
Higher than the heav'n above,
Deeper than the deepest sea,
Lasting as eternity;
Love that found me wondrous tho't!
Found me when I sought him not.

3.
Chief of sinners tho' I be,
Christ is all in all to me;
All my wants to him are known,
All my sorrows are his own;
Safe with him from earthly strife,
He sustains the hidden life.
