####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Heaven is not far away,
When Jesus is near;
Give your heart to him today,
When Jesus is near.
Place your trust in this dear Friend,
He will keep you to the end;
Heaven is not far away,
When Jesus is near.

2.
Will you not repent, believe,
When Jesus is near?
Peace and pardon now receive,
When Jesus is near.
He will not your pray'r refuse,
Come and now the Saviour choose;
Heaven is not far away,
When Jesus is near.

3.
Are you coming home to-day?
When Jesus is near?
Do not longer stay away,
When Jesus is near.
Cast your burdens on the Lord,
He has promised in his word
Heaven is not far away,
When Jesus is near.

```
