####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Jesus, let thy pitying eye
Call back a wand'ring sheep;
False to thee, like Peter, I
Would fain like Peter, weep.
Speak the reconciling word,
And let thy mercy melt me down;
Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
And break my heart of stone.

2.
Saviour, Prince, enthroned above,
Repentance to impart,
Give me, thro' thy dying love,
The humble, contrite heart;
Give what I have long implor'd,
A portion of thy grief unknown;
Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
And break my heart of stone.

3.
For thine own compassion's sake,
The gracious wonder show;
Cast my sins behind thy back,
And wash me white as snow:
If thy pity now is stirr'd,
If now I do myself bemoan,
Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
And break my heart of stone.

4.
Clothe me with thy holiness,
Thy meek humility;
Put on me thy glorious dress
Endue my soul with thee:
Let thine image be restor'd,
Thy name and nature let me prove;
Fill me with thy fulness, Lord,
And perfect me in love.
