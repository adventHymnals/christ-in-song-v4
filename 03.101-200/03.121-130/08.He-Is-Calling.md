## 128. HE IS CALLING
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
There's a wideness in God's mercy,
Like the wideness of the sea;
There's a kindness in his justice,
Which is more than liberty.

Refrain:
He is calling, "Come to me;" 
Lord, I gladly follow thee!

2.
There is welcome for the sinner,
And more graces for the good;
There is mercy with the Saviour;
There is healing in his blood.  [Refrain]

3.
There's no place where earthly sorrows
Are more felt than up in heav'n;
There's no place where earthly failings
Have such kindly judgment giv'n.  [Refrain]

4.
For the love of God is broader
Than the measure of man's mind;
And the heart of the Eternal
Is most wonderfully kind.  [Refrain]

5.
But we make his love too narrow,
By false limits of our own;
And we magnify his strictness
With a zeal he will not own.  [Refrain]

6.
If our love were but more simple,
We should take him at his word;
And our lives would be all sunshine
In the sweetness of our Lord.  [Refrain]
