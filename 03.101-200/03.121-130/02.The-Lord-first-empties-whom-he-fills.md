        Christ in Song 122. The Lord first empties whom he fills. The Lord first empties whom he fills, Casts down whom he would raise; He quickens when the letter kills, Exalting thus his praise. When he applies his healing blood Unto a sin-sick soul, This balsam, pow'rful, precious, good, Ne'er fails to make it whole.

## 122. THE LORD FIRST EMPTIES WHOM HE FILLS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The Lord first empties whom he fills,
Casts down whom he would raise;
He quickens when the letter kills,
Exalting thus his praise.
When he applies his healing blood
Unto a sin-sick soul,
This balsam, pow'rful, precious, good,
Ne'er fails to make it whole.

2.
On us he spent his life and blood,
Our losses to retrieve;
Mankind's redemption now holds good
For sinners who believe.
Lord, I believe!  whate'er befall,
A thankful heart be mine,
A heart that answers to thy call,
One that is wholly thine.

```
