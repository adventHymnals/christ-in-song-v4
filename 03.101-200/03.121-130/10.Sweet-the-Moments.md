## 130. SWEET THE MOMENTS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,
Which before the cross we spend;
Life and health and peace possessing
From the sinner's dying Friend.

2.
Truly blessed is this station,
Low before His cross to lie,
While we see divine compassion
Beaming in His gracious eye.

3.
Here we feel our sins forgiven,
While upon the Lamb we gaze;
And our tho'ts are all of heaven,
And our lips o'erflow with praise.
