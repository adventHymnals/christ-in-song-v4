        Christ in Song 354. Songs of Praise. Songs of praise the angels sang; Heav'n with alleluias rang, When Jehovah;s work begun, When he spake and it was done. Songs of praise awoke the morn, When the Prince of Peace was born; Songs of praise arose, when he  Captive led captivity.

```txt
1.
Songs of praise the angels sang;
Heav'n with alleluias rang,
When Jehovah;s work begun,
When he spake and it was done.
Songs of praise awoke the morn,
When the Prince of Peace was born;
Songs of praise arose, when he 
Captive led captivity.

2.
Heav'n and earth shall pass away,
Songs of praise shall crown that day;
God will make new heav'n and earth,
Songs of praise shall hail their birth.
And can man alone be dumb
Till that glorious kingdom come?
No; the Church delights to raise
Psalms and hymns and songs of praise.

3.
Saints below with heart and voice,
Still in songs of praise rejoice;
Learning here, by faith and love,
Songs of praise to sing above.
Hymns of glory, songs of praise,
Father, unto thee we raise;
Jesus, glory unto thee,
With the Spirit ever be.
