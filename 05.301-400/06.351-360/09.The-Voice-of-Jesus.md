####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
"Come unto me and rest;
Lay down; thou weary one lay down
Thy head upon my breast."
I came to Jesus as I was
Weary, and worn, and sad;
I found in him a resting place,
And he has made me glad.

2.
I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
"Behold, I freely give
The living water; thirsty one,
Stoop down and drink and live."
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
And now I live in him.

3.
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
"I am this dark world's light.
Look unto me; thy morn shall rise,
And all thy days be bright."
I look'd to Jesus, and I found
In him my star, my sun;
And in that light of life I'll walk,
Till all my journey's done.
