## 357. O THOU WHO ART OF ALL THAT IS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O Thou who art of all that is
Beginning and the end,
We follow thee thro' unknown paths,
Since all to thee must tend;
Thy judgments are a mighty deep,
Beyond all fathom line;
Our wisdom is the child-like heart;
Our strength, to trust in thine.

2.
We bless thee for the skies above,
And for the earth beneath;
For hopes that blossom here below,
And wither not with death;
But most ye bless thee for thyself,
O heavenly Light within,
Whose dayspring in our hearts, dispels
The darkness of our sin.
