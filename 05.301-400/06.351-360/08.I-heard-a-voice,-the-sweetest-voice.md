        Christ in Song 358. I heard a voice, the sweetest voice. I heard a voice, the sweetest voice That ever mortal heard; O how it made my heart rejoice, And every feeling stirred! 'Twas Jesus spoke to me so mild; He called me to his side, And said, although with heart defiled, I might in him confide.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I heard a voice, the sweetest voice
That ever mortal heard;
O how it made my heart rejoice,
And every feeling stirred!
'Twas Jesus spoke to me so mild;
He called me to his side,
And said, although with heart defiled,
I might in him confide.

2.
I saw his face, the fairest face
That ever mortal saw;
I longed the Saviour to embrace,
From him new life to draw.
"Come unto me," he kindly said,
"And I will give thee rest;
The ransom-price I fully paid;
Repent!  believe!  be blest!"

3.
I felt his love, the strongest love
That mortal ever felt;
O, how it drew my soul above,
And made my hard heart melt!
My burden at his feet I laid,
And knew the joy of heaven,
As in my willing ear he said
The blessed word, "Forgiven!"
