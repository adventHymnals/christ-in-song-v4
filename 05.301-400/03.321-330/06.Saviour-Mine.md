####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
To Thee, O dear, dear Saviour!
My spirit turns for rest,
My peace is in Thy favor,
My pillow on Thy breast;
Tho' all the world deceive me,
I know that I am Thine,
And Thou wilt never leave me,
O blessed Saviour mine.

2.
In Thee my trust abideth,
On Thee my hope relies,
O Thou whose love provideth
For all beneath the skies;
It was Thy mercy found me,
From bondage set me free,
And then for ever bound me
With threefold cords to Thee.

3.
My grief is in the dullness
With which this sluggish heart
Doth open to the fullness
Of all Thou wouldst impart;
My hope is in Thy beauty
Of holiness divine,
My joy is in the duty
That binds my life in Thine.  Amen
