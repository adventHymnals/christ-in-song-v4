## 322. WORD OF GOD INCARNATE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O Word of God incarnate,
O Wisdom from on high,
O Truth unchanged, unchanging,
O Light of our dark sky!
We praise Thee for the radiance
That from the hallow'd page,
A lamp to guide our footsteps,
Shine on from age to age.

2.
The Church from her dear Master
Received the gift divine,
And still that light she lifteth
O'er all the earth to shine;
It is the golden casket
Where gems of truth are stored,
It is the heav'n drawn picture
Of Christ, the living Word.

3.
It floateth like a banner
Before God's host unfurled:
It shineth like a beacon
Above the darkling world;
It is the chart and compass
That o'er life's surging sea,
Mid mists and rocks and quicksands,
Still guides, O Christ, to Thee.

4.
O make Thy Church, dear Saviour,
A lamp of purest gold,
To bear before the nations
Thy true light as of old;
O teach Thy wand'ring pilgrims
By this their path to trace,
Till, clouds and darkness ended,
They see Thee face to face.  Amen.
