## 381. AGAIN WE MEET
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Father, again in Jesus' name we meet,
And bow in penitence beneath Thy feet;
Again to Thee our grateful voices raise,
To sue for mercy, and to sing Thy praise.

2.
O we would bless Thee for Thy ceaseless care,
And all Thy love from day to day declare!
Is not our life with hourly mercies crowned?  
Does not Thine arm encircle us around?

3.
Alas!  unworthy of Thy boundless love,
Too oft with careless feet from Thee we rove;
But now encouraged by Thy voice, we come,
Returning sinners, to a Father's home.  Amen.

4.
O by that name in which all fullness dwells,
O by that love which ev'ry love excels,
O by that blood so freely shed for sin,
Open blest Mercy's gate, and take us in.  Amen.
