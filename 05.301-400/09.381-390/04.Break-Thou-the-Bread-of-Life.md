## 384. BREAK THOU THE BREAD OF LIFE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Break Thou the bread of life,
Dear Lord, to me,
As Thou didst break the loaves
Beside the sea;
Beyond the sacred page
I seek Thee, Lord;
My spirit pants for Thee,
O living Word!

2.
Bless Thou the truth, revealed
This day to me,
As Thou didst bless the bread
By Galilee;
Then shall all bondage cease,
All fetters fall;
And I shall find in Thee
My All-in-All!

3.
Spirit and Life are they,
Words Thou dost speak;
I hasten to obey,
But I am weak;
Thou art my only help,
Thou art my life;
Heeding Thy holy word
I win the strife.
