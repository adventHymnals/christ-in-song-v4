1.
My life, my love, I give to thee,
Thou Lamb of God, who died for me;
O, may I ever faithful be,
My Saviour and my God!

Chorus:
I'll live for him who died for me;
How happy then my life shall be!
I'll live for him who died for me,
My Saviour and my God!

2.
I now believe thou dost receive,
For thou hast died that I might live,
And now henceforth I'll trust in thee,
My Saviour and my God!  [Chorus]

3.
O thou who died on Calvary,
To save my soul and make me free,
I consecrate my life to thee,
My Saviour and my God!  [Chorus]
