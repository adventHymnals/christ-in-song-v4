####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Welcome, delightful morning,
Thou day of sacred rest;
I hail thy kind return;
Lord, make these moments blest.
From the low train of mortal toys
I soar to reach immortal joys,
I sour to reach immortal joys.

2.
Now may the King descend,
And fill his throne of grace;
Thy scepter, Lord, extend,
While saints address thy face;
Let sinners feel thy quick'ning word,
And learn to know and fear the Lord.

3.
Descend, celestial Dove,
With all thy quick'ning pow'rs;
Disclose a Saviour's love,
And bless these sacred hours;
Then shall my soul new life obtain,
Nor Sabbath-days be passed in vain.

```
