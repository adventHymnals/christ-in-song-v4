## 370. FLING OUT THE BANNER!
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Fling out the banner!  let it float
Skyward and seaward, high and wide;
Our glory only in the cross;
Our only hope, the Crucified.

2.
Fling out the banner!  angels bend
In anxious silence o'er the sign,
And vainly seek to comprehend
The wonder of the love Divine.

3.
Fling out the banner!  sin-sick souls,
That sink and perish in the strife,
Shall touch in faith its radiant hem,
And spring immortal into life.

4.
Fling out the banner!  wide and high,
Seaward and skyward, let it shine:
Nor skill, nor might, nor merit ours;
We conquer only in that sign.
