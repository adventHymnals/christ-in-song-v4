####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Awake, my soul, to joyful lays,
And sing thy great Redeemer's praise;
He justly claims a song from me,
His loving kindness, O how free!
Loving kindness, loving kindness,
His loving kindness, etc.

2.
He saw me ruin'd in the fall,
Yet lov'd me notwithstanding all;
He sav'd me from my lost estate,
His loving kindness, O how great!
Loving kindness, loving kindness,
His loving kindness, etc.

3.
Tho' num'rous hosts of mighty foes,
Tho' earth and hell my way oppose,
He safely leads my soul along,
His loving kindness, O how strong!
Loving kindness, loving kindness,
His loving kindness, etc.

4.
When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,
Has gather'd thick and thunder'd loud,
He near my soul has always stood,
His loving kindness, O how good!
Loving kindness, loving kindness,
His loving kindness, etc.
