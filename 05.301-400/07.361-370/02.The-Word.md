## 362. THE WORD
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
A glory in the word we find
When grace restores our sight;
But sin has darkened all the mind,
And vail'd the heav'nly light.
And vail'd the heav'nly light.

2.
When God's own Spirit clears our view,
How bright the doctrines shine!
Their holy fruits and sweetness show
The author is divine.
The author is divine.

3.
How blest are we, with open face
To view thy glory, Lord,
And all thy image here to trace,
Reflected in thy word!
Reflected in thy word!

4.
O teach us, as we look, to grow
In holiness and love,
That we may long to see and know
Thy glorious face above.
Thy glorious face above.
