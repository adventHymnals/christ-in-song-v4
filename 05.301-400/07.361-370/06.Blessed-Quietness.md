####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Joys are flowing like a river,
Since the Comforter has come;
He abides with us forever,
Makes the trusting heart his home.

Chorus:
Blessed quietness, holy quietness, 
Sweet assurance in my soul;
On the stormy sea,
Jesus speaks to me,
And the billows cease to roll.

2.
O what holy peace and gladness!
What a comfort is our Guest,
No more unbelief and sadness,
As obeying now we rest.  [Chorus]

3.
Like the rain that falls from heaven,
Like the sunlight from the sky,
So the Holy Ghost is given,
Coming gently from on high.  [Chorus]

4.
Lo!  a fruitful field is growing,
Blessed fruits of righteousness;
And the streams of life are flowing
In the lonely wilderness.  [Chorus]

5.
What a wonderful salvation,
Where we always see his face!
What a peaceful habitation!
What a quiet resting place!  [Chorus]
