1.
We praise thee, O God, for the Son of thy love,
For Jesus who died and is now gone above.

Chorus:
Hallelujah!  thine the glory,
Hallelujah!  amen;
Hallelujah!  thine the glory,
Revive us again.

2.
We praise thee, O God, for thy Spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Saviour, and scatter'd our night.  [Chorus]

3.
All glory and praise to the Lamb that was slain,
Who has borne all our sins, and has cleans'd ev'ry stain.  [Chorus]

4.
All glory and praise to the God of all grace,
Who has bought us, and sought us, and guided our ways.  [Chorus]

5.
Revive us again; fill each heart with thy love;
May each soul be rekindled with fire from above.  [Chorus]
