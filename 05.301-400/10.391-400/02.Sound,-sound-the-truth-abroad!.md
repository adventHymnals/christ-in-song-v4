#### Advent Hymnals
## 392. SOUND, SOUND THE TRUTH ABROAD!
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Sound, sound the truth abroad!
Bear ye the word of God
Through the wide world;
Tell what our Lord has done,
Tell how the day is won,
And from his lofty throne
Satan is hurled.

2.
Ye who, forsaking all
At your loved Master's call,
Comforts resign;
Soon will your work be done,
Soon will the prize be won;
Brighter than yonder sun
Then shall ye shine.

```
