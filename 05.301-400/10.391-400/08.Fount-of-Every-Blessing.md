## 398. FOUNT OF EVERY BLESSING
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Come, thou Fount of ev'ry blessing,
Tune my heart to sing thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing, 
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me ever to adore thee,
May I still thy goodness prove,
While the hope of endless glory
Fills my heart with joy and love.

2.
Here I raise my Ebenezer,
Hither by thy help I've come,
And I hope by thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wand'ring from the fold of God;
He to rescue me from danger
Interposed his precious blood.

3.
O, to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let thy goodness like a fetter
Bind me closer still to thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love,
Here's my heart, O, take and seal it;
Seal it for thy courts above.
