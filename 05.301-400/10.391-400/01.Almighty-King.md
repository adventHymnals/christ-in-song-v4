####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Come, thou almighty King,
Help us thy name to sing,
Help us to praise.
Father all glorious,
O'er all victorious,
Come, and reign over us,
Ancient of Days.

2.
Come, holy Comforter,
Thy sacred witness bear
In this glad hour:
Thou who almighty art,
Rule now in ev'ry heart,
And ne'er from us depart,
Spirit of pow'r.

3.
Thou art the mighty One,
On earth thy will be done,
From shore to shore.
Thy sov'reign majesty 
May we in glory see,
And to eternity
Love and adore.
