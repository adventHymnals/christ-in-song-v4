```txt
1.
Hover o'er me, Holy Spirit,
Bathe my trembling heart and brow;
Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,
Come, O come and fill me now.
Fill me now, fill me now,
Jesus, come and fill me now.
Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,
Come, O come and fill me now.

2.
Thou canst fill me, gracious Spirit,
Tho' I cannot tell thee how;
But I need thee, greatly need thee;
Come, O come and fill me now.
Fill me now, fill me now,
Jesus, come and fill me now.
Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,
Come, O come and fill me now.

3.
I am weakness, full of weakness;
At thy sacred feet I bow;
Blest, divine, eternal Spirit,
Fill with love, and fill me now.
Fill me now, fill me now,
Jesus, come and fill me now.
Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,
Come, O come and fill me now.

4.
Cleanse and comfort, bless and save me;
Bathe, O, bathe my heart and brow;
Thou art conforting and saving,
Thou art sweetly filling now.
Fill me now, fill me now,
Jesus, come and fill me now.
Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,
Come, O come and fill me now.
