```txt
1.
Where He may lead me I will go,
For I have learned to trust Him so,
And I remember 'twas for me,
That He was slain on Calvary.

Chorus:
Jesus shall lead me night and day,
Jesus shall lead me all the way,
He is the truest Friend to me,
For I remember Calvary.

2.
O I delight in His command,
Love to be led by His dear hand,
His divine will is sweet to me,
Hallowed by blood-stained Calvary.  [Chorus]

3.
Onward I go, nor doubt, nor fear,
Happy with Christ, my Saviour near,
Trusting that I some day shall see
Jesus my Friend, of Calvary.  [Chorus]
