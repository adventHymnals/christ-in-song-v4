```txt
1.
I know I love thee better, Lord,
Than any earthly joy;
For thou hast given me the peace
Which nothing can destroy.

Chorus:
The half has never yet been told,
Of love so full and free;
The half has never yet been told,
The blood it cleanseth me.

2.
I know that thou art nearer still
Than any earthly throng;
And sweeter is the tho't of thee
Than any lovely song.  [Chorus]

3.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart;
Then may I well be glad;
Without the secret of thy love 
I could not but be sad.  [Chorus]

4.
O Saviour, precious Saviour, mine!
What will thy presence be,
If such a life of joy can crown
Our walk on earth with thee?  [Chorus]
