####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
God loved the world of sinners lost
And ruined by the fall;
Salvation full, at highest cost,
He offers free to all.

Chorus:
Oh, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love!
The love of God to me;
It bro't my Saviour from above,
To die on Calvary.

2.
E'en now by faith I claim Him mine,
The risen Son of God;
Redemption by His death I find,
And cleansing thro' the blood.  [Chorus]

3.
Love brings the glorious fullness in,
And to His saints makes known,
The blessed rest from inbred sin,
Thro' faith in Christ alone.  [Chorus]

4.
Believing souls, rejoicing go;
There shall to you be giv'n
A glorious foretaste, here below,
Of endless life in heav'n.  [Chorus]

5.
Of vict'ry now o'er Satan's pow'r
Let all the ransom'd sing,
And triumph in the dying hour
Thro' Christ the Lord, our King.  [Chorus]
