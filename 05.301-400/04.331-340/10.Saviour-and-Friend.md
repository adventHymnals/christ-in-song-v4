####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Rest of the weary, 
Joy of the sad,
Hope of the dreary, 
Light of the glad;
Home of the stranger, 
Strength to the end,
Refuge from danger, 
Saviour and Friend;
Refuge from danger, 
Saviour and Friend,
Saviour and Friend.

2.
Pillow where lying, 
Love rests her head;
Peace of the dying, 
Life of the dead;
Path of the lowly,
Prize at the end,
Breath of the holy,
Saviour and Friend;
Breath of the holy, 
Saviour and Friend,
Saviour and Friend.

3.
When my feet stumble,
To Thee I cry;
Crown of the humble, 
Cross of the high;
When my steps wander,
Over me bend,
Truer and fonder,
Saviour and Friend;
True and fonder,
Saviour and Friend,
Saviour and Friend.

4.
Ever confessing Thee,
I will raise
Unto Thee blessing,
Glory, and praise;
All my endeavor,
World without end,
Thine to be ever,
Saviour and Friend;
Thine to be ever,
Saviour and Friend,
Saviour and Friend.
