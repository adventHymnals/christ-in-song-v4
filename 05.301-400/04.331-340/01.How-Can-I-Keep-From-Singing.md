        Christ in Song 331. How Can I Keep From Singing?. My life flows on in endless song; Amid earth's lamentation, I hear the sweet, tho' far-off hymn That hails a new creation; Thro' all the tumult and the strife I hear the music ringing; It finds an echo in my soul, How can I keep from singing?

#### Advent Hymnals
## 331. HOW CAN I KEEP FROM SINGING?
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
My life flows on in endless song;
Amid earth's lamentation,
I hear the sweet, tho' far-off hymn
That hails a new creation;
Thro' all the tumult and the strife
I hear the music ringing;
It finds an echo in my soul,
How can I keep from singing?

2.
What tho' my joys and comforts die,
The Lord my Helper liveth!
What tho' the darkness gather round;
Songs in the night he giveth!
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that refuge clinging;
Since God is Lord of heav'n and earth,
How can I keep from singing?

3.
I lift mine eyes; the cloud grows thin;
I see the blue above it;
And day by day this pathway smooths
Since first I learned to love it.
The peace of God makes fresh my heart,
A fountain ever springing;
All things are mine, since I am His
How can I keep from singing?
