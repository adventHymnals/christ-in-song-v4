```txt
1.
Lord, thy glory fills the heaven;
Earth is with its fulness stored;
Unto thee be glory given,
Holy, holy, holy Lord!
Heav'n is still with anthems ringing;
Earth takes up the angel's cry,
Holy, holy, holy, singing,
Lord of hosts, thou Lord most high.

2.
Ever thus in God's high praises,
Brethren, let our tongues unite;
While our tho't his greatness raises,
And our love his gifts excite:
With his seraph train before him,
With his holy church below,
Thus unite we to adore him,
Bid we thus our anthem flow.

3.
Lord, thy glory fills the heaven,
Earth is with its fulness stored;
Unto thee be glory given,
Holy, holy, holy Lord!
Thus thy glorious name confessing,
We adopt the angel's cry,
Holy, holy, holy, blessing 
Thee, the Lord our God most high!
