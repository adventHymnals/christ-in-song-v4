## 347. HOLY RIVER
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Fresh from the throne of glory,
Bright in its crystal gleam,
Bursts out the living Fountain,
Swells on the living Stream.

Refrain:
Holy River, I would ever
Draw my life from thee;
Mighty River, I will never
Cease to sing of thee.

2.
Stream full of life and gladness,
Spring of all health and peace,
No harps by thee hang silent,
Nor happy voices cease.  [Refrain]

3.
River of God, I greet thee,
Now not afar, but near;
My soul to thy still waters
Hastes in its thirstings here.  [Refrain]

4.
Jesus, the healing Fountain,
Fresh from the throne above,
Thou art the living water,
Thou art the stream of love.  [Refrain]
