####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Hark!  ten thousand harps and voices
Sound the note of praise above;
Jesus reigns, and heav'n rejoices;
Jesus reigns, the God of love;
See, he sits on yonder throne;
Jesus rules the world alone.
Hallelujah!  hallelujah!  hallelujah! amen.

2.
King of glory, reign forever,
Thine an everlasting crown;
Nothing from thy love shall sever
Those whom thou dost seal thine own;
Happy objects of thy grace,
Destined to behold thy face.
Hallelujah!  hallelujah!  hallelujah!  amen.

3.
Saviour, hasten thine appearing;
Bring, O bring, the glorious day
When the awful summons bearing, 
Heav'n and earth shall pass away!
Then, with golden harps, we'll sing,
"Glory, glory to our King.
Hallelujah!  hallelujah!  hallelujah!  amen.
