        Christ in Song 346. Prayer for the Children. Heav'nly Father, send Thy blessing On the children gathered here, May they all, Thy name confessing, Hold Thy truth forever dear; May they be like Joseph, loving, Dutiful, and kind, and pure, And their faith, like Samuel proving, Steadfast in the right endure.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Heav'nly Father, send Thy blessing
On the children gathered here,
May they all, Thy name confessing,
Hold Thy truth forever dear;
May they be like Joseph, loving,
Dutiful, and kind, and pure,
And their faith, like Samuel proving,
Steadfast in the right endure.

2.
Holy Saviour, who in meekness
Came to earth a child to be,
Guide their steps and help their weakness,
Bless and make them like to Thee;
Bear Thy lambs when they are weary,
Safe upon Thy loving breast,
Thro' life's desert, dry and dreary,
Bring them to thy heav'nly rest.

3.
Spread Thy golden pinions o'er them,
Holy Spirit from above;
Guide them, lead them, go before them,
Give them peace, and joy, and love;
Temples of thy glorious Godhead,
May they with Thy presence shine,
And immortal bliss inherit,
And forevermore be Thine.
