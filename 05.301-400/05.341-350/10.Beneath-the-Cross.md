## 350. BENEATH THE CROSS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand;
The shadow of a mighty rock
Within a weary land.
A home within the wilderness, 
A rest upon the way,
From burning of the noontide heat,
And burdens of the day.

2.
Upon that cross of Jesus,
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me.
And from my smitten heart, with tears,
Two wonders I confess,
The wonders of His glorious love,
And my own worthlessness.

3.
I take, O cross, Thy shadow,
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face:
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss,
My sinful self, my only shame,
My glory, all the cross.

```
