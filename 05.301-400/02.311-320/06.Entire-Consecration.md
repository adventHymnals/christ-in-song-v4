```txt
1.
Take my life, and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my hands and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love.

Chorus:
Wash me in the Saviour's precious blood
Cleanse me in its purifying flood
Lord, I give to Thee, my life and all, to be,
Thine, henceforth eternally.

2.
Take my feet, and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee;
Take my voice and let me sing
Always, only, for my King.  [Chorus]

3.
Take my lips and let them be
Filled with messages for Thee;
Take my silver and my gold,
Not a mite would I withhold.  [Chorus]

4.
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in endless praise;
Take my intellect, and use,
Ev'ry pow'r as thou shalt choose.  [Chorus]

5.
Take my will, and make it Thine;
It shall be no longer mine!
Take my heart, it is thine own,
It shall be Thy royal throne.  [Chorus]

6.
Take my love, my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure store;
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee.  [Chorus]
