#### Advent Hymnals
## 318. THY LIFE WITHIN ME
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Live out Thy life within me,
O Jesus, King of kings!
Be Thou Thyself the answer
To all my questionings;
Live out Thy life within me,
In all things have Thy way!
I, the transparent medium
Thy glory to display.

2.
The temple has been yielded,
And purified of sin;
Let Thy Shekinah glory
Now shine forth from within,
And all the earth keep silence,
The body henceforth be
Thy silent, gentle servant,
Moved only as by Thee,

3.
Its members ev'ry moment
Held subject to Thy call,
Ready to have Thee use them,
Or not be used at all;
Held without restless longing,
Or strain, or stress, or fret,
Or chafings at Thy dealings,
Or tho'ts of vain regret;

4.
But restful, calm and pliant,
From bend and bias free,
Awaiting Thy decision,
When thou hast need of me.
Live out Thy life within me,
O Jesus, King of kings!
Be Thou the glorious answer
To all my questionings.
