## 311. TELL ME THE OLD, OLD STORY
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Tell me the old, old story,
Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory,
Of Jesus and His love.
Tell me the story simply,
As to a little child,
For I am weak and weary,
And helpless and defiled.

Chorus;
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story
Of Jesus and His love.

2.
Tell me the story slowly,
That I may take it in,
That wonderful redemption,
God's remedy for sin.
Tell me the story often,
For I forget so soon;
The "early dew" of morning
Has passed away at noon.  [Chorus]

3.
Tell me the same old story
When you have cause to fear
That this world's empty glory
Is costing me too dear.
Yes, and when that world's glory
Is dawning on my soul,
Tell me the old, old story:
Christ Jesus makes thee whole.  [Chorus]
