####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,
When Thou camest to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem's home there was found no room
For Thy holy nativity.

Refrain:
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
There is room in my heart for Thee!

2.
Heaven's arches rang when the angels sang,
Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
But in lowly birth didst Thou come to earth
And in great humility.

Refrain:  Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
There is room in my heart for Thee!

3.
Thou camest, O Lord, with the living word,
That should set Thy people free;
But with mocking scorn, and with crown of thorn,
They bore Thee to Calvary.

Refrain:
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
There is room in my heart for Thee!

4.
When heav'n's arches shall ring, and her choirs shall sing, 
At Thy coming to victory;
May Thy voice call me home, saying, "Yet there is room,
There is room at My side for thee."

Refrain:  
My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,
When Thou comest and callest me.
