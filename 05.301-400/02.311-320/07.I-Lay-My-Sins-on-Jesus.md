## 317. I LAY MY SINS ON JESUS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I lay my sins on Jesus,
The spotless Lamb of God;
He bears them all, and frees us
From the accursed load.
I bring my guilt to Jesus,
To watch the crimson stains
White in His blood most precious,
Till not one spot remains.

2.
I lay my wants on Jesus;
All fullness dwells in Him;
He heals all my diseases,
He doth my soul redeem:
I lay my griefs on Jesus,
My burdens and my cares,
He from them all releases,
He all my sorrow shares.

3.
I long to be like Jesus,
Meek, loving, lowly, mild;
I long to be like Jesus,
The Father's holy child:
I long to be with Jesus
Amid the heav'nly throng,
To sing with them His praises,
To learn the angel's song.

```
