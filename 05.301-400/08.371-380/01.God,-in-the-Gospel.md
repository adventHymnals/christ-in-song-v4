## 371. GOD, IN THE GOSPEL
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
God, in the gospel of His Son,
Makes His eternal counsels known;
Where love in all its glory shines,
And truth is drawn in fairest lines.

2.
Here sinners, of an humble frame,
May taste His grace, and learn His name;
May read in characters of blood,
The wisdom, pow'r and grace of God.

3.
The pris'ner here may break his chains,
The weary rest from all his pains,
The captive feel his bondage cease,
The mourner find the way of peace.

4.
Oh, grant us grace, Almighty Lord,
To read aright Thy holy word,
Its truth with meekness to receive,
And by its holy precepts live.
