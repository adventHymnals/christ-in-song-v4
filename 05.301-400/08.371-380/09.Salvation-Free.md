#### Advent Hymnals
## 379. SALVATION FREE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Come, ye that love the Lord,
And let your joy be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne.

Chorur:
I'm glad salvation's free,
I'm glad salvation's free;
Salvation's free for you and me;
I'm glad salvation's free.

2.
Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God;
But servants of the heav'nly King
May speak their joys abroad.  [Chorus]

3.
Then let our songs a bound,
And ev'ry tear be dry;
We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground
To fairer worlds on high.  [Chorus]
