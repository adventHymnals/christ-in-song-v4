1.
Praise ye the Lord; for it is good
Praise to our God to sing;
For it is pleasant, and to praise 
It is a comely thing.  

Chorus:
Praise the Lord, it is good
Praise to our God to sing:
For it is pleasant, and to praise
It is a comely thing.

2.
Those that are broken in their heart,
And troubled in their minds,
He healeth, and their painful wounds
He tenderly upbinds.  [Chorus]

3.
He counts the number of the stars;
He names them ev'ry one:
Our Lord is great, and of great pow'r,
His wisdom search can none.  [Chorus]
