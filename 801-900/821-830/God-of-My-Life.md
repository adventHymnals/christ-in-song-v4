[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z87mwbArRlpQo5vYp2As8MDBRbkJDiHs/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God of my life, whose gracious pow'r
    Thro' varied scenes my soul hath led,
    Or turned aside the fatal hour,
    Or lifted up my sinking head,

    2.
    I have no skill the snare to shun,
    But thou, O God, my wisdom art:
    I ever into danger run,
    But thou art greater than my heart.

    3.
    I rest beneath thy kindly shade;
    My griefs expire, my troubles cease;
    Thou, Lord, on whom my soul is stayed,
    Wilt keep me still in perfect peace.
