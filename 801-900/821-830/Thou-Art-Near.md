    1.
    O Love divine, that stooped to share
    Our sharpest pang, our bitterest tear!
    On thee we cast each earth-born care;
    We smile at pain while thou art near.

    2.
    When drooping pleasure turns to grief,
    And trembling faith is changed to fear,
    The murm'ring wind, the quiv'ring leaf,
    Shall softly tell us, "Thou art near!"

    3.
    On thee we fling our burd'ning woe,
    O love divine, forever dear;
    Content to suffer while we know,
    Living or dying, thou art near.
