[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yrXDnSdx7CL88j1n1kRbj9eh40DnzmiW/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O blest are they who oft have said, 
    "I thirst for righteousness;
    I hunger for the heav'nly Bread
    With anguish and distress."

    2.
    They of My fulness shall be fed,
    For which they hungered sore;
    And by the Living Waters led,
    Their souls shall thirst no more.

    3.
    Because I am the Truth, the Life,
    All fulness dwells in me;
    They know no want, no sin, no strife,
    Thro' all eternity.

    4.
    How blessed, then, to share a part
    With those that hunger here;
    To have the panting, thirsty heart,
    And shed the bitter tear!
