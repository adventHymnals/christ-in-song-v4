[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvKfbDNBbP%2D3Y%2DLoDbk_HuodJajybsin/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    At first I prayed for light:
    Could I but see the way,
    How gladly, swiftly would I walk
    To everlasting day!

    2.
    And next I prayed for strength:
    That I might tread the road
    With firm, unfalt'ring, feet and win
    The heaven's serene abode.

    3.
    And then I asked for faith:
    Could I but trust my God,
    I'd live unfolded in His peace,
    Tho' foes were all abroad.

    4.
    But now I pray for love:
    Deep love to God and man;
    A living love that will not fail,
    However dark His plan.

    5.
    And light and strength and faith
    Are opening everywhere!
    God waited patiently until
    I prayed the larger pray'r.
