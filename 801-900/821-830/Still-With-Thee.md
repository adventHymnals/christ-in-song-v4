[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zORZVCcULWne3yUJ6YGS4ZIl7x7moATs/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Still with thee, O my God!
    I would desire to be;
    By day, by night, at home, abroad,
    I would be still with thee.

    2.
    With thee when dawn comes in,
    And calls me back to care,
    Each day returning to begin
    With thee, my God, in pray'r.

    3.
    With thee when day is done,
    And evening calms the mind;
    The setting, as the rising sun,
    With thee my heart would find.

    4.
    With thee, in thee, by faith
    Abiding I would be;
    By day, by night, in life, in death,
    I would be still with thee.
