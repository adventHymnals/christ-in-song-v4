    1.
    'Tis by the faith of joys to come
    We walk thro' deserts dark as night;
    Till we arrive at heav'n, our home,
    Truth is our guide, and faith our light.

    2.
    The want of sight she well supplies;
    She makes the pearly gates appear;
    Far into distant worlds she pries,
    And brings eternal glories near.

    3.
    Tho' lions roar, and tempests blow,
    And rocks and dangers fill the way,
    With joy we tread the desert thro',
    While faith inspires a heav'nly ray.
