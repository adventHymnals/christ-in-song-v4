    1.
    My country, 'tis of thee,
    Sweet land of liberty,
    Of thee I sing;
    Land where my fathers died,
    Land of the pilgrims' pride,
    From ev'ry mountain side
    Let freedom ring.

    2.
    My native country, thee,
    Land of the noble, free,
    Thy name I love;
    I love thy rocks and rills,
    Thy woods and templed hills;
    My heart with rapture thrills
    Like that above.

    3.
    Let music swell the breeze,
    And ring from all the trees
    Sweet freedom's song;
    Let mortal tongues awake,
    Let all that breathe partake,
    Let rocks their silence break,
    The sound prolong.

    4.
    Our fathers' God, to thee,
    Author of liberty,
    To thee we sing;
    Long may our land be bright
    With freedom's holy light;
    Protect us by thy might,
    Great God, our King.
