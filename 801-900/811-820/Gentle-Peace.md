    1.
    Gentle Peace, from heav'n descended,
    We would live beneath thy law;
    Thou hast home and life befriended
    Born of nobler deeds than war.

    2.
    Thou hast thrown a smile of beauty
    O'er the meadow, hill, and grove;
    Thou hast quickened us to duty,
    Thou hast warmed our hearts to love.

    3.
    Stay thou with us, still replenish
    Fields with fruit, ourselves with love;
    Discord and dissension banish,
    Peaceful spirits from above.
