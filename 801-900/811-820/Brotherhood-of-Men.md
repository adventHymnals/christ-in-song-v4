    1.
    God bless our native land!
    May Heaven's protecting hand
    Still guard our shore.
    May peace her pow'r extend,
    Foe be transformed to friend,
    And all our rights depend
    On war no more.

    2.
    May just and righteous laws
    Uphold the public cause,
    And bless our name;
    Home of the brave and free,
    Stronghold of Liberty,
    We pray that still on thee
    May rest no stain.

    3.
    And not this land alone,
    But be thy mercies known
    From shore to shore;
    O that all men would see
    That they should brothers be,
    And form one family,
    The wide world o'er!
