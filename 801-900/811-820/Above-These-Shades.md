[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y0FO%2DCLIUF3Fwfrw6zuCvVaz%2DvBPiR_a/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O could our thoughts and wishes fly,
    Above these gloomy shades,
    To those bright worlds beyond the sky,
    Where sorrow ne'er invades!

    2.
    There, joys unseen by mortal eyes,
    Or reason's feeble ray,
    In ever blooming prospect rise,
    Exposes to no decay.

    3.
    Lord, send a beam of light divine,
    To guide our upward aim;
    With one reviving look of thine,
    Our languid hearts inflame.

    4.
    O then, on faith's sublimest wing,
    Our ardent souls shall rise,
    To those bright scenes where pleasures spring
    Immortal in the skies.
