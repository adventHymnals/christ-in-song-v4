    1.
    Shepherd divine, thou leadest me
    Where the still waters gently flow;
    In pastures fair thou feedest me;
    I trust thy love, no want I know.

    2.
    In danger's hour thou hidest me,
    Safe from the foe of thy dear flock;
    At sultry noon thou guidest me
    To rest beside the cooling rock.

    3.
    When chilling dews of evening fall,
    Then to the fold thou bidst me come;
    Gladly I hasten at thy call;
    Sweet is the voice that calls me home.
