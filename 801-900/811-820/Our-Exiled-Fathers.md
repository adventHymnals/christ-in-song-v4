    1.
    O God, beneath thy guiding hand,
    Our exiled fathers cross the sea;
    And when they trod the wintry strand,
    With pray'r and psalm they worshiped thee.

    2.
    Truth, freedom, justice, faith in God,
    Came with those exiles o'er the waves;
    And where their pilgrim feet have trod,
    The God they trusted guards their graves.

    3.
    And here thy name, O God of love,
    May we, their children, still adorn,
    Till these eternal hills remove,
    And spring adorns the earth no more.
