    1.
    Father, whate'er of earthly bliss
    Thy sov'reign will denies,
    Accepted at thy throne of grace,
    Let this petition rise:

    2.
    Give me a calm, a thankful heart,
    From ev'ry murmur free;
    The blessings of thy grace impart,
    And make me live to thee.

    3.
    Let the sweep hope that thou art mine
    My life and death attend;
    Thy presence thro' my journey shine,
    And crown my journey's end.
