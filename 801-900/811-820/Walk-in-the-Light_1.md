    1.
    Walk in the light! so shalt thou know
    That fellowship of love His Spirit only can bestow
    Who reigns in light above,
    Who reigns in light above.

    2.
    Walk in the light!  and thou shalt own 
    Thy darkness passed away;
    Because that light on thee hath shone
    In which is perfect day,
    In which is perfect day.

    3.
    Walk in the light!  and e'en the tomb
    No fearful shade shall wear;
    Glory shall chase away its gloom,
    For Christ hath conquered there,
    For Christ hath conquered there.

    4.
    Walk in the light!  and thine shall be 
    A path, tho' theory, bright;
    For God, by grace, shall dwell in thee,
    And God himself is light,
    And God himself is light.
