    1.
    Face to face with Christ my Saviour,
    Face to face what will it be?
    When with rapture I behold Him,
    Jesus Christ who died for me.

    Chorus:
    Face to face shall I behold Him,
    Far beyond the starry sky;
    Face to face in all His glory,
    I shall see Him by and by!

    2.
    Only faintly now, I see Him,
    With the dark'ning veil between,
    But a blessed day is coming,
    When His glory shall be seen.  [Chorus]

    3.
    What rejoicing in His presence,
    When are banished grief and pain,
    When the crooked ways are straightened,
    And the dark things shall be plain!  [Chorus]

    4.
    Face to face!  O!  blissful moment!
    Face to face to see and know;
    Face to face with my Redeemer,
    Jesus Christ who loves me so.  [Chorus]
