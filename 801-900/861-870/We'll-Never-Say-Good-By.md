    1.
    With friends on earth we meet in gladness,
    While swift the moments fly,
    Yet ever comes the tho't of sadness,
    That we must say "Good-by."

    Chorus:
    We'll never say good-by in heav'n,
    We'll never say good-by,
    In that fair land of joy and song
    We'll never say good-by.

    2.
    How joyful is the hope that lingers,
    When loved ones say "Farewell,"
    That we, when all earth's toils are ended,
    With them shall ever dwell.  [Chorus]

    3.
    No parting words shall e'er be spoken
    In yonder home so fair;
    But songs of joy, and peace, and gladness,
    We'll sing forever there.  [Chorus]
