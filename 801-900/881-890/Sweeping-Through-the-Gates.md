    1.
    Who, who are these beyond the chilly wave,
    Just past the borders of the silent grave,
    Shouting Jesus' pow'r to save?
    Washed in the blood of the Lamb.

    Chorus:
    Sweeping thro' the gates to the New Jerusalem,
    Washed in the blood of the Lamb;
    Sweeping thro' the gates to the New Jerusalem,
    Washed in the blood of the Lamb.

    2.
    These, these are they who in their youthful days
    Found Jesus early, and in wisdom's ways
    Proved the fulness of his grace,
    Washed in the blood of the Lamb.  [Chorus]

    3.
    These, these are they who in affliction's woes,
    Ever have found in Jesus calm repose,
    Peace which from a pure heart flows,
    Washed in the blood of the Lamb.  [Chorus]

    4.
    These, these are they who in the conflict dire,
    Boldly have stood amid the hottest fire;
    Jesus now says, "Come up higher;"
    Washed in the blood of the Lamb.  [Chorus]

    5.
    Safe, safe upon the everlasting shore,
    Sin, pain, and death, and sorrow all are o'er;
    Happy now and evermore,
    Washed in the blood of the Lamb.  [Chorus]
