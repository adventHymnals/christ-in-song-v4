    1.
    There is a land mine eye hath seen
    In visions of enraptured tho't,
    So bright, that all which spreads between
    Is with its radiant glories fraught.

    Chorus:
    Oh, land of love, of joy and light
    Thy glories gild earth's darkest night;
    Thy tranquil shore, we, too, shall see,
    When day shall break and shadows flee.

    2.
    A land upon whose blissful shore
    There rests no shadow, falls no stain;
    There those who meet shall part no more,
    And those long parted meet again.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Its skies are not like earthly skies,
    With varying hues of shade and light;
    It hath no need of suns, to rise
    To dissipate the gloom of night.  [Chorus]

    4.
    There sweeps no desolating wind
    Across the calm, serene abode.
    The wand'rer there a home may find
    Within the paradise of God.  [Chorus]
