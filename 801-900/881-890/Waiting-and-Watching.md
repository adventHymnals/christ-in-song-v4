    1.
    We know not the time when He cometh,
    At even, or midnight, or morn;
    It may be at deepening twilight,
    It may be at earliest dawn.
    He bids us to watch and be ready,
    Nor suffer our lights to grow dim;
    That when He shall come, He may find us, 
    All waiting and watching for Him.

    Chorus:
    Waiting and watching,
    Waiting and watching;
    Waiting and watching,
    Still waiting and watching for Thee.

    2.
    I think of His wonderful pity,
    The price our salvation hath cost;
    He left the bright mansions of glory
    To suffer and die for the lost.
    And sometimes I think it will please Him,
    When those whom He died to redeem,
    Rejoice in the hope of His coming
    By waiting and watching for Him.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O Jesus, my loving Redeemer,
    Thou knowest I cherish as dear
    The hope that mine eyes shall behold Thee,
    That I shall thine own welcome hear!
    If to some as a Judge thou appearest,
    Who forth from Thy presence would feel,
    A Friend most beloved I'll greet Thee,
    I'm waiting and watching for Thee.  [Chorus]
