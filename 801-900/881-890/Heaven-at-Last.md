    1.
    Angel voices sweetly singing,
    Echoes thro' the blue dome ringing,
    News of wondrous gladness bringing;
    Ah, 'tis heav'n at last!

    Refrain:
    Heav'n at last, heav'n at last;
    O, the joyful story of heav'n at last!
    Heav'n at last, heav'n at last;
    Endless, boundless glory,
    In heav'n at last.

    2.
    On the jasper threshold standing,
    Like a pilgrim safely landing,
    See the strange, bright scene expanding;
    Ah, 'tis heav'n at last!  [Refrain]

    3.
    Softest voices, silver pealing,
    Freshest fragrance, spirit healing,
    Happy hymns around us stealing;
    Ah, 'tis heav'n at last!  [Refrain]

    4.
    Not a teardrop ever falleth,
    Not a pleasure ever palleth,
    Song to song forever calleth;
    Ah, 'tis heav'n at last!  [Refrain]

    5.
    Christ, himself, the living splendor,
    Christ the sunlight, mild and tender;
    Praises to the Lamb we render;
    Ah, 'tis heav'n at last!  [Refrain]
