    1.
    I am waiting for the morning
    Of the day that brings release,
    Waiting for the golden dawning
    Of God's everlasting peace.

    Chorus:
    Hasten on, day eternal!
    Bid the night of sorrow cease;
    Usher in love supernal,
    Bring the golden golden dawn of peace.

    2.
    O'er the hilltops brightly breaking,
    Sun of Righteousness arise,
    Ev'ry soul from slumber waking
    As God's glory gilds the skies.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Endless joy for hours of crying,
    Everlasting peace for care;
    Immortality for dying,
    Hallelujahs glad, for prayer!  [Chorus]
