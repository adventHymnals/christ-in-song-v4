    1.
    Come, we that love the Lord,
    And let our joys be known,
    Join in a song with sweet accord,
    Join in a song with sweet accord,
    And thus surround the throne,
    And thus surround the throne.

    Chorus:
    We're marching to Zion,
    Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
    We're marching upward to Zion,
    The beautiful city of God.

    2.
    Let those refuse to sing
    Who never knew our God;
    But children of the heav'nly King,
    But children of the heav'nly King,
    May speak their joys abroad,
    May speak their joys abroad.  [Chorus]

    3.
    The hill of Zion yields
    A thousand sacred sweets,
    Before we reach the heav'nly fields,
    Before we reach the heav'nly fields,
    Or walk the golden streets,
    Or walk the golden streets.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Then let our song abound,
    And ev'ry tear be dry;
    We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground,
    We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground,
    To fairer worlds on high, 
    To fairer worlds on high.  [Chorus]
