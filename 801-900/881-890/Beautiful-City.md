    1.
    Beautiful city, haven of peace,
    Beautiful home where weeping shall cease;
    When shall thy gates be opened to me?
    When shall I rest forever in thee?

    Refrain:
    Beautiful city, haven of peace,
    Home of the soul, where weeping shall cease;
    Beautiful city, waiting for me,
    When shall I rest forever in thee?

    2.
    Beautiful city, haven of joy,
    Heavenly praise our tongues shall employ;
    Glad are thy songs that never grow old,
    Bright are thy walls of jasper and gold.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Beautiful city, haven of rest,
    Beautiful mansions, home of the blest;
    O how I long thy glories to see!
    Beautiful city, waiting for me.  [Refrain]
