    1.
    Some day the silver cord will break,
    And I no more as now shall sing;
    But, O, the joy when I shall wake
    Within the palace of the King!

    Chorus:
    And I shall see Him face to face,
    And tell the story  Saved by grace!
    And I shall see Him face to face,
    And tell the story  Saved by grace.

    2.
    Some day my earthly house will fall,
    I cannot tell how soon 'twill be,
    But this I know my All in All
    Has now a place in heav'n for me.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Some day, when fades the golden sun
    Beneath the rosy-tinted west,
    My blessed Lord shalt say, "Well done!"
    And I shall enter into rest.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Someday; till then I'll watch and wait,
    My lamp all trimmed and burning bright.
    That when my Saviour ope's the gate, 
    My soul to Him may take its flight.  [Chorus]
