    1.
    One sweetly solemm tho't,
    Comes to me o'er and o'er;
    I'm nearer to my home today,
    Than e'er I've been before.

    Chorus:
    Nearer my home,
    Nearer my home;
    Nearer my home today, today,
    Than e'er I've been before.

    2.
    Nearer my Father's house,
    Where many mansions be;
    Nearer the throne where Jesus reigns,
    Nearer the crystal sea.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Nearer my going home,
    Laying my burdens down,
    Leaving my cross of heavy grief,
    Wearing my starry crown.  [Chorus]
