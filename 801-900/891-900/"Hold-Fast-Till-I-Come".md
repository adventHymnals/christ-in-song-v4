    1.
    Sweet promise is giv'n to all who believe,
    "Behold I come quickly, mine own to receive;
    Hold fast till I come; the danger is great;
    Sleep not as do others; be watchful, and wait,"

    Chorus:
    "Hold fast till I come;" sweet promise of heavn'n,
    "The kingdom restored, to you shall be giv'n."
    "Come, enter my joy, sit down on my throne;
    Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come."

    2.
    We'll "watch unto pray'r" with lamps burning bright;
    He comes to all others a "thief in the night."
    We know he is near, but know not the day,
    As spring shows that summer is not far away.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Yes!  this is our hope, 'tis built on His word,
    The glorious appearing of Jesus, our Lord;
    Of promises all, it stands as the sum:
    "Behold I come quickly, hold fast till I come."  [Chorus]
