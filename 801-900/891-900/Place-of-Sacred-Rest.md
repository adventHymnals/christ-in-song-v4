    1.
    There is a place of sacred rest,
    Far, far beyond the skies,
    Where beauty smiles eternally,
    And pleasure never dies;
    My Father's house, my heav'nly home,
    Where many mansions stand,
    Prepared, by hands divine, for all
    Who seek the better land.

    2.
    When tossed upon the waves of life,
    With fear on ev'ry side,
    When fiercely howls the gath'ring storm
    And foams the angry tide,
    Beyond the storm, beyond the gloom,
    Breaks forth the light of morn,
    Bright beaming from my Father's house,
    To cheer the soul forlorn.

    3.
    In that pure home of tearless joy
    Earth's parted friends shall meet,
    With smiles of love that never fade,
    And blessedness complete.
    There, there adieus are sounds unknown;
    Death frowns not on that scene,
    But life and glorious beauty shine,
    Untroubled and serene.
