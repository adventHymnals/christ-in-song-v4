    1.
    When the mists have rolled in splendor
    From the beauty of the hills,
    And the sunshine, warm and tender,
    Falls in kisses on the rills,
    We may read love's shining letter
    In the rainbow of the spray;
    We shall know each other better
    When the mists have cleared away.

    Chorus:
    We shall know as we are known,
    Nevermore to walk alone,
    In the dawning of the morning,
    When mists have cleared away;
    In the dawning of the morning,
    When the mists have cleared away.

    2.
    If we err in human blindness,
    And forget that we are dust,
    If we miss the law of kindness
    When we struggle to be just,
    Snowy wings of peace shall cover
    All the errors of today,
    When the weary watch is over,
    And the mists have cleared away.  [Chorus]

    3.
    When the mists have ris'n above us,
    As our Father knows his own, 
    Face to face with those that love us,
    We shall know as we are known;
    Far beyond the orient meadows 
    Floats the golden fringe of day;
    Heart to heart we bide the shadows,
    Till the mists have cleared away.  [Chorus]
