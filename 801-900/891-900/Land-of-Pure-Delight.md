## 899.  Land of Pure Delight
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xd4Wmq0jr2pPNVncDA8%2Dw5pppB2yZB50/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There is a land of pure delight,
    Where saints immortal reign;
    Infinite day excludes the night,
    And pleasures banish pain.
    There everlasting spring abides,
    And never with'ring flow'rs,
    And but a little space divides
    This heav'nly land from ours.

    2.
    Pure is the land the saints espy,
    And all the region peace;
    No wanton lips nor envious eye
    Can see or taste the bliss.
    Those holy gates forever bar
    Pollution, sin, and shame;
    None shall obtain admittance there
    But foll'wers of the Lamb.

    3.
    O could we make our doubts remove
    Those gloomy doubts that rise,
    And see the Canaan that we love,
    With unbeclouded eyes;
    Could we but climb where Moses stood,
    And view the landscape o'er,
    Not all this world's pretended good
    Could ever charm us more.
