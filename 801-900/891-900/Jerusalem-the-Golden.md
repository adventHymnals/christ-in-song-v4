    1.
    Jerusalem the golden,
    With milk and honey blest,
    Beneath thy contemplation
    Sink heart and voice oppress'd:
    I know not, O I know not
    What holy joy are there;
    What radiancy of glory,
    What bliss beyond compare.

    2.
    There is the throne of David,
    And there, from care releas'd.
    The song of them that triumph,
    The shout of them that feast;
    And they who with their Leader,
    Have conquered in the fight,
    Forever and forever
    Are clad in robes of white.

    3.
    O sweet and blessed country,
    The home of God's elect!
    O sweet and blessed country,
    That eager hearts expect!
    Jesus in mercy bring us
    To that dear land of rest;
    Who art with God the Father,
    And Spirit ever blest.
