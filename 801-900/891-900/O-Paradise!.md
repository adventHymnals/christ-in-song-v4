    1.
    O Paradise!  O Paradise!
    Who doth not crave for rest?
    Who would not seek the happy land
    Where they that love are blest?

    Refrain:
    Where loyal hearts and true
    Stand ever in the light,
    All rapture thro' and thro',
    In God's most holy sigh.

    2.
    O Paradise!  O Paradise!
    The world is growing old;
    Who would not be at rest and free
    Where love is never cold?  [Refrain]

    3.
    O Paradise!  O Paradise!
    I want to sin no more;
    I want to be as pure on earth
    As on thy spotless shore.  [Refrain]

    4.
    O Paradise!  O Paradise!
    I would so faithful be,
    That when my race on earth has run
    That race may end in thee.  [Refrain]
