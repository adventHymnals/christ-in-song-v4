    1.
    When we hear the music ringing
    In the bright celestial dome,
    When sweet angel voices, singing,
    Gladly bid us welcome home,
    To the land of ancient story,
    Where the dwellers know no care,
    In that land of light and glory;
    Shall we know each other there?

    Chorus:
    Shall we know each other?
    Shall we know each other?
    Shall we know each other?
    Shall we know each other there?

    2.
    When the holy angels meet us,
    As we go to join their band,
    Shall we know the friends that greet us
    In the glorious, happy land?
    Shall we see the same eyes shining,
    On us as in days of yore?
    Shall we feel the same arms twining,
    Fondly round us as before?  [Chorus]

    3.
    Yes, my earth-worn soul rejoices,
    And my weary heart grows light;
    For the sweet immortal voices
    And th' angelic faces bright
    That shall sing with us the story
    Of redemption round the throne,
    Are with us the heirs of glory,
    And we'll know as we are known.

    Chorus:  We shall know each other,
    We shall know each other,
    We shall know each other,
    We shall know each other there.

    4.
    O ye weary, sad, and tossed ones!
    Droop not, faint not by the way;
    Ye shall join the loved and lost ones
    In the land of perfect day.
    Harp strings touched by angel fingers,
    Murmur in my raptured ear;
    Evermore their sweet song lingers,
    "We shall know each other there!"

    Chorus:
    We shall know each other,
    We shall know each other,
    We shall know each other,
    We shall know each other there.
