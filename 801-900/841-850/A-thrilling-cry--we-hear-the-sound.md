    1.
    A thrilling cry--we hear the sound;
    The faithful watchmen lift their voice;
    From land to land the world around
    It bids the saints rejoice;
    Ye pilgrims, rise, break forth and sing
    The glorious coming of your King;
    The thrilling cry--we hear it sound,
    "Prepare to meet your Lord."

    2.
    Blow, watchmen, blow the certain sound,
    For dark and dangerous in the night;
    And daring scoffers gather round
    The evil servants smite.
    Ye faithful ones, the strict watch keep.
    With lamps well trimmed, and do not sleep
    The thrilling cry--we hear it sound,
    "Prepare to meet your Lord."

    3.
    In earth's dark hour God's word gives light,
    Its rays dispel the thickening gloom;
    The path to glory now is bright
    The Bridegroom soon will come.
    Then lift your voices, saints, and sing
    Your sweetest strains to Zion's King
    The thrilling cry--we hear it sound,
    "Prepare to meet your Lord."
