    1.
    I'm but a stranger here,
    Heav'n is my home;
    Earth is a desert drear,
    Heav'n is my home;
    Danger and sorrow stand 
    Round me on ev'ry hand,
    Heav'n is my Fatherland,
    Heav'n is my home.

    2.
    What though the tempest rage,
    Heaven is my home;
    Short is my pilgrimage,
    Heaven is my home.
    Time's cold and wintry blast
    Soon will be overpast;
    I shall reach home at last;
    Heaven is my home.

    3.
    There at my Saviour's side,
    Heaven is my home,
    I shall be glorified,
    Heaven is my home.
    There'll be the good and blest,
    Those I love most and best;
    There, too, I soon shall rest;
    Heaven is my home.
