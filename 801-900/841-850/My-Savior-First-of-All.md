    1.
    When my lifework is ended, and I cross the swelling tide,
    When "this mortal puts on immortality;"
    I shall know my Redeemer when I reach the other side,
    And his smile will be the first to welcome me.

    Chorus:
    I shall know him, I shall know him
    As redeemed by his side I shall stand,
    I shall know him, I shall know him
    By the prints of the nails in his hands.

    2.
    O, the soul thrilling rapture when I view his blessed face,
    And the luster of his kindly beaming eye;
    How my full heart will praise him for the mercy, love, and grace,
    That prepares for me a mansion in the sky.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O, the dear ones departed!  How the tender mem'ries come,
     As the farewell at the river I recall;
    In the sweet vales of Eden we shall meet no more to roam,
    But I long to see my Saviour first of all.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Thro' the gates to the city, in a robe of spotless white,
    He will lead me where no tears shall ever fall;
    In the glad song of ages I shall mingle with delight;
    But I long to meet my Saviour first of all  [Chorus]
