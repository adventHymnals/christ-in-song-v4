    1.
    O land of rest, for thee I sigh;
    When will the moment come
    When I shall lay my armor by, 
    And dwell with Christ at home?

    Chorus:
    We'll work till Jesus comes,
    We'll work till Jesus comes,
    We'll work till Jesus comes,
    And we'll be gathered home.

    2.
    No tranquil joys on earth I know,
    No peace, shelt'ring dome;
    This world's a wilderness of woe,
    This world is not my home.

    3.
    When by affliction sharply tried,
    Faith tells of scenes to come,
    Those endless joys prepared above,
    And then I sigh for home.
