    1.
    Thou coming One, our wants relieve
    In this our evil day;
    To all thy tempted followers give
    The pow'r to watch and pray.
    Long as our fiery trials last, 
    Long as the cross we bear,
    O may our souls on thee be cast,
    In all-prevailing pray'r.

    2.
    The pow'r of interceding grace
    Give us in faith to claim;
    To wrestle till we see thy face,
    And know thy hidden name.
    Till then thy perfect love impart;
    Till thou appear below
    Be this the cry of ev'ry heart,
    "I will not let thee go."

    3.
    I will not let thee go, unless
    Thou tell thy name to me;
    With all thy great salvation bless,
    And make me all like thee.
    Then shall I on the mountain-top 
    Behold thy open face,
    Where faith in sight is swallowed up,
    And prayer in joyful praise.
