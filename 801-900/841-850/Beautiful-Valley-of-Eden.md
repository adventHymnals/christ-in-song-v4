    1.
    Beautiful valley of Eden, 
    Sweet is thy noon-tide calm;
    Over the hearts of the weary,
    Breathing thy waves of balm.  [Chorus]

    2.
    Over the heart of the mourner
    Shineth the golden day,
    Wafting the songs of the angels
    Down from the far away.  [Chorus]

    3.
    There is the home of my Saviour
    There with the blood-washed throng;
    Over the highland of glory
    Rolleth the great new song.  [Chorus]
