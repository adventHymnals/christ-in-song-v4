    1.
    When I shall awake in that fair morn of morns,
    After whose dawning never night returns,
    And with whose bright glory day eternal burns,
    I shall be satisfied then.

    Refrain:
    I shall be satisfied then,
    I shall be satisfied then.
    When I shall awake, in that fair morn of morns,
    I shall be satisfied then.

    2.
    And when I shall see His glory face to face,
    Hear his glad welcome, feel his fond embrace,
    And feast on the fulness of his heav'nly grace,
    I shall be satisfied then.  [Refrain]

    3.
    And when I shall meet the friends that I have loved,
    Clasp to my bosom dear ones long removed,
    And witness how faithful Christ to me that proved,
    I shall be satisfied then.  [Refrain]

    4.
    O soon I shall gaze upon the face of Him,
    Pierced to redeem me from the curse of sin,
    And praise him forever with the glad new hymn;
    I shall be satisfied then.  [Refrain]
