    1.
    Who are these whose songs are sounding
    O'er the golden harps above?
    Hark!  they tell of grace abounding
    And Jehovah's sov'reign love.

    Chorus:
    These are they who wash'd their robes
    and made them white in the blood of the Lamb
    These are they who wash'd their robes 
    and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

    2.
    Who are these that keep their station
    Round the great eternal throne?
    They from earthly tribulation
    To their heav'nly rest are gone.  [Chorus]

    3.
    See their robes of dazzling whiteness,
    Without blemish, spot or stain;
    See their crowns that grow in brightness
    Purchas'd by the Lamb once slain.  [Chorus]

    4.
    'Tis the Lamb of God who leads them,
    And they serve Him night and day,
    By the heav'nly fount He leads them
    He hath wiped their tears away.  [Chorus]

    5.
    Sweet the theme:  'tis still "salvation 
    Unto Christ the Holy One."
    And their sighs of tribulation
    Change to songs around the throne.  [Chorus]
