    1.
    Sorrow and care may meet,
    The tempest cloud may low'r,
    The surge of sin may beat
    Upon earth's troubled shore;

    Refrain:
    God doth his own in safety keep;
    He giveth his beloved sleep,
    He giveth his beloved sleep.

    2.
    The din of war may roll
    With all its raging flight;
    Grief may oppress the soul
    Thro'out the weary night; [Refrain]

    3.
    In childhood's winsome page,
    In manhood's joyous bloom,
    In feebleness and age,
    In death's dark, gath'ring gloom; [Refrain]
