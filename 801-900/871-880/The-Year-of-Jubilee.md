    1.
    Oh, glory to God!  it is coming again,
    'Tis the glad jubilee of the children of men;
    Then blow ye the trumpet, shout glory and sing,
    And join in the praises of Jesus the King.

    Chorus:
    Shout with the voice of triumph,
    Soon shall the saints be free;
    Glory to the Lord!  hallelujah!  
    Hasten the jubilee!

    2.
    'Tis the glad antitype of that day long ago,
    When the hosts of the Lord might not gather or sow;
    When the minions of Israel from labor were free,
    And the land was to rest in the glad jubilee.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Yes, gladder by far is that rest "by and by,"
    When on wings like the eagle we mount to the sky;
    We shall dwell evermore in that land of the blest,
    In that grand jubilee, in that sabbath of rest. [Chorus]
