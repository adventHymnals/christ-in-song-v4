    1.
    Breaking thro' the clouds that gather
    O'er the Christian's natal skies,
    Distant beams, like floods of glory,
    Fill the soul with glad surprise;
    And we almost hear the echo
    Of the pure and holy throng,
    In the bright, the bright forever,
    In the summer land of song.

    Chorus:
    On the banks beyond the river
    We shall meet, no more to sever;
    In the bright, the bright forever,
    In the summer land of song.

    2.
    Yet a little while we linger
    Ere we reach our journey's end;
    Yet a little while of labor,
    Ere the ev'ning shades descend;
    Then we'll lay us down to slumber,
    But the night will soon be o'er;
    In the bright, the bright forever,
    We shall wake, to weep no more.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O the bliss of life eternal!
    O the long unbroken rest!
    In the golden fields of pleasure,
    In the region of the blest;
    But, to see our dear Redeemer,
    And before his throne to fall,
    There to hear his gracious welcome,
    Will be sweeter far than all.  [Chorus]
