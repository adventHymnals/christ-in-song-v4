    1.
    Soul amid earth sorrows dwelling,
    Sighing for the strife to cease,
    Lo!  the promise sweet foretelling
    Soon shall come the Prince of Peace.

    Chorus:
    I shall be satisfied then,
    I shall be satisfied then;
    When the King of kings, with angels attending,
    Rends the azure sky, in glory descending,
    When the saints awake in his own likeness,
    I shall be satisfied then.

    2.
    Saddened by the world's complaining,
    Burdened with the ceaseless care,
    Tell me!  is there rest remaining
    For the toilers over there?  [Chorus]

    3.
    Patient wait God's time for going,
    Murmur not though long thy stay,
    Ever trusting, ever knowing
    Thou shalt dwell with him some day.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Born of God, the soul can never
    Willing here with sin abide;
    Earth is not the glad forever
    Where the soul is satisfied.  [Chorus]
