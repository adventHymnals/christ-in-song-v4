    1.
    Watch, ye saints, with eyelids waking;
    Lo!  the powers of heav'n are shaking;
    Keep your lamps all trimm'd and burning,
    Ready for your Lord's returning.

    Refrain:
    Lo!  he comes, lo!  Jesus comes;
    Lo!  he comes, he comes, all glorious!
    Jesus comes to reign victorious,
    Lo!  he, comes, yes, Jesus comes.

    2.
    Lo!  the promise of your Saviour,
    Pardoned sin and purchased favor,
    Blood-wash'd robes and crowns of glory;
    Haste to tell redemption's story.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Kingdoms at their base are crumbling,
    Hark!  his chariot wheels are rumbling;
    Tell, O tell of grace abounding,
    Whilst the seventh trump is sounding.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Nations wane, tho' proud and stately;
    Christ his kingdom hasteneth greatly;
    Earth her latest pangs is summing;
    Shout, ye saints, your Lord is coming.  [Refrain]

    5.
    Sinners, come, while Christ is pleading;
    Now for you he's interceding;
    Haste, ere grace and time diminished
    Shall proclaim the mystery finished.  [Refrain]
