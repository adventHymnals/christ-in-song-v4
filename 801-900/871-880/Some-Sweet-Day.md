    1.
    We shall meet beyond the skies,
    Some sweet day, some sweet day;
    Gaze no more in tearful eyes,
    Some sweet day, some sweet day.

    Refrain:
    We shall clasp our own again, 
    Free from sorrow, sin, and pain;
    We shall wish no more in vain,
    Some sweet day, some sweet day.

    2.
    There will be no vacant chair,
    Some sweet day, some sweet day,
    Nor a mourning circle there,
    Some sweet day, some sweet day.

    Refrain:
    Death shall hear its note of doom,
    Christ shall burst the sealed tomb,
    Dust shall wake in beauty's bloom,
    Some sweet day, some sweet day.

    3.
    Winter's frost or summer's heat,
    Some sweet day, some sweet day,
    Make no harvest incomplete,
    Some sweet day, some sweet day.

    Refrain:
    Eden bloom is ev'rywhere,
    Fadeless flow'rs perfume the air,
    Christ Himself the sunlight fair, 
    Some sweet day, some sweet day.

    4.
    Mansion, crown, and harp of gold,
    Some sweet day, some sweet day;
    Songs that never shall grow old,
    Some sweet day, some sweet day.

    Refrain:
    Joy shall bid farewell to Care,
    Praise shall sing no more with Prayer,
    Love shall lead us, over there,
    Some sweet day, some sweet day.
