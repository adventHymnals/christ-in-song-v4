    1.
    The Homeland!  O the Homeland!
    The land of the freeborn!
    There's no night in the Homeland,
    But aye the fadeless morn;
    I'm sighing for the Homeland,
    My heart is aching here;
    There is no pain in the Homeland
    To which I'm drawing near;
    There is no pain in the Homeland
    To which I'm drawing near.

    2.
    My Lord is in the Homeland,
    With angels bright and fair;
    There's no sin in the Homeland,
    And no temptation there;
    The music of the Homeland
    Is ringing in my ears;
    And when I think of the Homeland
    My eyes are filled with tears;
    And when I think of the Homeland
    My eyes are filled with tears.

    3.
    The dwellers in the Homeland
    Are beck'ning me to come,
    Where neither death nor sorrow 
    Invades their holy home;
    O dear, dear native country!
    O rest and peace above!
    Christ bring us all to the Homeland
    Of Thy redeeming love;
    Christ bring us all to the Homeland
    Of Thy redeeming love.
