    1.
    Our Lord is now rejected,
    And by the world disowned,
    By the many still neglected,
    And by the few enthroned,
    But soon He'll come in glory,
    The hour is drawing nigh,
    For the crowning day is coming by and by.
    Oh, the crowning day is coming, 
    Is coming by and by,
    When our Lord shall come in "power," 
    And "glory" from on high,
    Oh, the glorious night will gladden,
    Each waiting watchful eye,
    In the crowning day that's coming by and by.

    2.
    The heav'ns shall glow with splendor,
    But brighter far than they
    The saints shall shine in glory,
    As Christ shall them array,
    The beauty of the Saviour,
    Shall dazzle ev'ry eye,
    In the crowning day that's coming by and by.
    Oh, the crowning day is coming, 
    Is coming by and by,
    When our Lord shall come in "power," 
    And "glory" from on high,
    Oh, the glorious night will gladden,
    Each waiting watchful eye,
    In the crowning day that's coming by and by.

    3.
    Our pain shall then be over,
    We'll sin and sigh no more,
    Behind us all of sorrow,
    And naught but joy before,
    A joy in our Redeemer,
    As we to Him are nigh,
    In the crowning day that's coming by and by.
    Oh, the crowning day is coming, 
    Is coming by and by,
    When our Lord shall come in "power," 
    And "glory" from on high,
    Oh, the glorious night will gladden,
    Each waiting watchful eye,
    In the crowning day that's coming by and by.

    4.
    Let all that look for, hasten
    The coming joyful day,
    By earnest consecration,
    To walk the narrow way,
    By gath'ring in the lost ones,
    For whom our Lord did die,
    For the crowning day that's coming by and by.
    Oh, the crowning day is coming, 
    Is coming by and by,
    When our Lord shall come in "power," 
    And "glory" from on high,
    Oh, the glorious night will gladden,
    Each waiting watchful eye,
    In the crowning day that's coming by and by.
