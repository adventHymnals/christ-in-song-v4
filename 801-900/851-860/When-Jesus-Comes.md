    1.
    Down life's dark vale we wander,
    Till Jesus comes;
    We watch and wait and wonder,
    Till Jesus comes.

    Chorus
    All joy His lov'd ones bringing,
    When Jesus comes;
    All praise thro' heaven ringing,
    When Jesus comes.
    All beauty bright and vernal,
    When Jesus comes;
    All glory, grand, eternal,
    When Jesus comes.

    2.
    Oh, may my lamp be burning
    When Jesus comes;
    For Him my soul be yearning,
    When Jesus comes.  [Chorus]

    3.
    No more heart pangs nor sadness,
    When Jesus comes;
    All peace and joy and gladness,
    When Jesus comes.  [Chorus]

    4.
    All doubts and fears will vanish,
    When Jesus comes;
    All gloom His face will banish,
    When Jesus comes.  [Chorus]

    5.
    He'll know the way was dreary,
    When Jesus comes;
    He'll know the feet grew weary,
    When Jesus comes. [Chorus]

    6.
    He'll know what griefs oppressed me,
    When Jesus comes;
    Oh, how His arms will rest me!
    When Jesus comes.  [Chorus]
