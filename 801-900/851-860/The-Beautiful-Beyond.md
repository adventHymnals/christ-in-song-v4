    1.
    Above the clouds that veil the blue
    Beyond the stars that glimmer through,
    There is a home unknown to care,
    Its gates ajar invite me there.

    Chorus:
    O home of beauty, free from sorrow!
    O everlasting glad tomorrow!

    2.
    The stream of life with ceaseless flow,
    The holy joy that angels know,
    The golden harp, the song divine,
    The spotless robe Faith calls them mine.  [Chorus]

    3.
    The flow'rs that sleep neath winter's snow.
    The loves ones lost to us below,
    The voices hush'd that used to sing,
    We'll find them where Christ is King.  [Chorus]
