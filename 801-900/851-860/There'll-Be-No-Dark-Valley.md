    1.
    There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes,
    There's be no dark valley when Jesus comes;
    There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes
    To gather His loved ones home.

    Refrain:
    To gather His loved ones home,
    To gather His loved ones home;
    There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes
    To gather His loved ones home.

    2.
    There'll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes,
    There'll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes;
    But a glorious morrow when Jesus comes
    To gather His loved ones home.  [Refrain]

    3.
    There'll be no more weeping when Jesus comes,
    There'll be no more weeping when Jesus comes;
    But a blessed reaping when Jesus comes
    To gather His loved ones home.  [Refrain]

    4.
    There'll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,
    There'll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes;
    And a joyful meeting when Jesus comes
    To gather His loved ones home.  [Refrain]
