    1.
    We shall reach the summer land,
    Some sweet day, by and by;
    We shall press the golden strand,
    Some sweet day, by and by;
    O the loving welcome there,
    By the tree of life so fair!
    How we long that joy to share,
    Some sweet day, by and by.

    Refrain:
    By and by,
    Some sweet day,
    We shall meet our lov'd ones gone,
    Some sweet day, by and by.

    2.
    At the crystal river's brink,
    Some sweet day, by and by;
    We shall find each broken link,
    Some sweet day, by and by;
    Then the star that, fading here,
    Left our hearts and homes so drear,
    We shall see more bright and clear,
    Some sweet day, by and by.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Oh, these parting scenes will end,
    Some sweet day, by and by;
    We shall gather friend with friend,
    Some sweet day, by and by;
    There before our Father's throne,
    When the mists and clouds have flown,
    We shall know as we are known,
    Some sweet day, by and by.  [Refrain]
