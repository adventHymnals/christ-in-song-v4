[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tOmbpdfa3SP%2DjaqaNoySfPUk5_fnSDet/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Spirit of truth and might,
    'Tis Thou alone canst teach
    Both young and old to use aright
    The wondrous power of speech.

    2.
    The tongue can no man tame;
    It is a deadly ill;
    And hence Thy gracious aid we claim,
    To bend it to Thy will.

    3.
    May all our words below
    Be prompted by Thy love,
    Till we are called to hear and know
    The speech of saints above.
