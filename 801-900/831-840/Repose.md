    1.
    Now the day is over,
    Night is drawing nigh,
    Shadows of the evening
    Steal across the sky.

    2.
    Father, give the weary
    Calm and sweet repose,
    With thy tend'rest blessing
    May our eye-lids close.

    3.
    Thro' the long night watches,
    May thine angels spread
    Their white wings above me,
    Watching round my bed.  Amen.
