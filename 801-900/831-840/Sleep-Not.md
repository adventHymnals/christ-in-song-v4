## 835.  Sleep Not
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tD5fpQajo7hJISEN50iVNxjSsjVsDYf0/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Sleep not, soldier of the cross;
    Foes are lurking all around:
    Look not here to find repose;
    This is but thy battle ground.

    2.
    Up, and take thy shield and sword;
    Up, it is the call of heav'n;
    Shrink not faithless from thy Lord,
    Nobly strive as He hath striv'n.

    3.
    Break thro' all the force of ill,
    Treat the might of passion down,
    Struggle onward, onward still,
    To the conqu'ring Saviour's crown.

    4.
    Thro' the midst of toil and pain,
    Let this tho't ne'er leave thy breast,
    Ev'ry triumph thou dost gain
    Makes more sweet thy coming rest.
