    1.
    O teach me, Lord, that I may teach
    The precious things Thou dost impart;
    And wing my words, that they may reach
    The hidden depths of many a heart.

    2.
    O fill me with Thy fulness, Lord,
    Until my very heart o'erflow
    In kindly tho't and glowing word,
    Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.

    3.
    O use me, Lord, use even me,
    Just as Thou wilt, and when, and where;
    Until Thy blessed face I see,
    Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.
