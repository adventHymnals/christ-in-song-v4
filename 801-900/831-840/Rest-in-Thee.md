[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tHOfcrVWC7akEmhhlgfHMpDAVH4vtEh3/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Come, thou long-expected Jesus,
    Born to set Thy people free:
    From our fears and sins release us,
    Let us find our rest in Thee.

    2.
    Born Thy people to deliver,
    Born a child, and yet a King;
    Born to reign in us forever,
    Now Thy gracious Kingdom bring.

    3.
    By Thine own eternal Spirit,
    Rule in all our hearts alone;
    By Thine all-sufficient merit,
    Raise us to Thy glorious throne.
