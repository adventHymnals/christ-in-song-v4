    1.
    Lord, speak to me, that I may speak
    In living echoes of Thy tone;
    As Thou hast sought, so let me seek
    Thy erring children lost and lone.

    2.
    O lead me, Lord, that I may lead
    The wand'ring and the wav'ring feet;
    O feed me, Lord, that I may feed
    Thy hung'ring ones with manna sweet.

    3.
    O strengthen me, that while I stand
    Firm on the Rock, and strong in Thee,
    I may stretch out a loving hand
    To wrestlers with the troubled sea.
