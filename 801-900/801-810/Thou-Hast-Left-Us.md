    1.
    Sister, thou wast mild and lovely,
    Gentle as the summer breeze;
    Pleasant as the air of evening
    When it floats among the trees.

    2.
    Dearest sister, thou hast left us!
    Here thy loss we deeply feel;
    But 'tis God that hath berelf us,
    He can all our sorrows heal.

    3.
    Yet again we hope to meet thee,
    When this mortal life is fled;
    Then, in heav'n, with joy to greet thee,
    Where no farewell tear is shed.
