    1.
    Blessed Bible, how I love it!
    How it doth my bosom cheer!
    What hath earth like this to covet?
    O, what stores of wealth are here!

    2.
    'Tis a fountain ever bursting,
    Whence the weary may obtain
    Water for the soul that's thirsting,
    That it may not thirst again.

    3.
    'Tis a chart that never faileth,
    One which God to man has giv'n;
    And tho' oft the storm assaileth,
    It will guide us safe to heav'n.

    4.
    'Tis a pearl of price exceeding
    All the gems in ocean found;
    All its sacred precepts heeding,
    So shall we in grace abound.
