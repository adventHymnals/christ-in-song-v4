[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wSJqJSnjkce_oIls22fS9PUYOoMdgLuq/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    What is the chaff, the word of man,
    When set against the wheat?
    Can it a dying soul sustain
    Like that immortal meat?

    2.
    Thy word, O God, with heav'nly bread
    Thy children doth supply;
    And those who by thy word are fed,
    Their souls shall never die.

    3.
    'Tis like a field where hidden lies
    The pearl of price unknown,
    And he indeed is truly wise
    Who makes this pearl his own.
