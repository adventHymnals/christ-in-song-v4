    1.
    In grief and fear, to thee, O Lord,
    We now for succor fly;
    Thine awful judgments are abroad,
    O shield us, lest we die.

    2.
    O look with pity on the scene 
    Of sadness and of dread;
    And let thine angel stand between
    The living and the dead.

    3.
    With contrite hearts to thee, our King,
    We turn who oft have strayed;
    Accept the sacrifice we bring,
    And let the plague be stayed.
