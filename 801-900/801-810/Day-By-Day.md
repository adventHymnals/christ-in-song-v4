    1.
    Day by day the manna fell;
    O to learn this lesson well!
    Still by constant mercy fed,
    Give me, Lord, our daily bread.

    2.
    "Day by day," the promise reads
    Daily strength for daily needs;
    Cast foreboding fears away,
    Take the manna of today.

    3.
    Lord, our times are in thy hand;
    All our sanguine hopes have plann'd
    To thy wisdom we resign,
    And would mold our wills to thine.

    4.
    Thou our daily task shalt give;
    Day by day to thee we live;
    So shall added years fulfil
    Not our own, our Father's will.
