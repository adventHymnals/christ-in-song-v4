    1.
    I will early seek the Saviour,
    I will learn of Him each day;
    I will follow in His footsteps,
    I will walk the narrow way.

    Chorus:
    For He loves me, yes, He loves me,
    Jesus loves me, this I know;
    Jesus loves me, died to save me,
    This is why I love Him so.

    2.
    I will hasten where He bids me,
    I am not too young to go,
    In the pathway where He leadeth,
    Not too young His will to know.  [Chorus]

    3.
    He is standing at the doorway
    Of escape from ev'ry sin;
    I will knock, for He has promised,
    He will hear and let me in.  [Chorus]
