    1.
    Now just a word for Jesus;
    Your dearest Friend so true,
    Come, cheer our hearts and tell us
    What He has done for you.

    Refrain:
    Now just a word for Jesus
    'Twill help us on our way;
    One little word for Jesus,
    O speak, or sing, or pray.

    2.
    Now just a word for Jesus;
    You feel your sins forgiv'n,
    And by His grace are striving
    To reach a home in heav'n.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Now just a word for Jesus;
    A cross it cannot be
    To say, "I love my Saviour
    Who gave His life for me"  [Refrain]

    4.
    Now just a word for Jesus;
    Let not the time be lost;
    The heart's neglected duty
    Brings sorrow to its cost.  [Refrain]

    5.
    Now just a word for Jesus;
    And if your faith be dim,
    Arise in all your weakness,
    And leave the rest to Him.  [Refrain]
