[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y2yESE5TEHPiB8NWU6M_iY2mUCZfMPjV/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Look upon Jesus, sinless is He;
    Father, impute His life unto me.
    My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
    Cover with His life, whiter than snow.

    Refrain:
    Cover with His life, whiter than snow,
    Fulness of His life then shall I know;
    My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
    Cover with His life, whiter than snow.

    2.
    Deep are the wounds transgression has made;
    Red are the stains, my soul is afraid,
    O to be covered, Jesus, with Thee,
    Safe from the law that now judgeth me!  [Refrain]

    3.
    Longing the joy of pardon to know,
    Jesus holds out a robe white as snow:
    "Lord, I accept it!  leaving my own,
    Gladly I wear Thy pure life alone."  [Refrain]

    4.
    Reconciled by His death for my sin,
    Justified by His life pure and clean,
    Sanctified by obeying His word,
    Glorified when returneth my Lord.  [Refrain]
