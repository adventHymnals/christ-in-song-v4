    1.
    Softy and tenderly Jesus is calling,
    Calling for you and for me;
    At the heart's portal He's waiting and watching,
    Watching for you and for me.

    Chorus:
    Come home, come home,
    Ye who are weary, come home;
    Earnestly tenderly, Jesus is calling,
    Calling, O sinner, come home!

    2.
    Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,
    Pleading for you and for me;
    Why should we linger and heed not His mercies,
    Mercies for you and for me?  [Chorus]

    3.
    Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing,
    Passing from you and from me;
    Shadows are gath'ring and death's night is coming,
    Coming for you and for me.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Think of the wonderful love He has promised,
    Promised for you and for me;
    Tho' we have sinned He has mercy and pardon,
    Pardon for you and for me.  [Chorus]
