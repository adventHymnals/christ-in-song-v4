[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XlVZMB68PKgx0BPs36lx39LkKXR4kCWT/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Like as a father, pities his child,
    So the Lord pities the sinner defiled;
    Waiteth in kindness,
    Pities our blindness,
    Longeth to welcome, tho' often reviled.

    2.
    Like as a father when we believe,
    Merciful Saviour, He waits to receive;
    Listens to hear us,
    Blesses to cheer us,
    Pities whenever His Spirit we grieve.

    3.
    Like as a father, ever the same,
    He that created, and knoweth our frame;
    Watcheth the straying,
    Guardeth the praying,
    Bids us to trust in His Almighty name.

    4.
    Like as a father, constant is He,
    God is our passion regardeth our plea;
    In need He cometh, 
    Precious His promise;
    Father in heaven for ever to be.
