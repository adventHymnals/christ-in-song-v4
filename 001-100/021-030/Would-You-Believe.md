[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bJehnB9lCPu9I0Kd%2DGZVBOH6Mi0625hd/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    If you could see Christ standing here tonight,
    His thorn-crown'd head and pierced hands could view;
    Could see those eyes that beam with heavn's own light,
    And hear Him say, "Beloved, 'twas for you:"

    Chorus:
    Would you believe, and Jesus receive,
    If He were standing here?
    Would you believe, and Jesus receive,
    If He were standing here?

    2.
    If you could see that face so calm and sweet,
    Those lips that spake words only pure and true;
    Could see the nail prints in His tender feet,
    And hear Him say, "Beloved, 'twas for you:"  [Chorus]

    3.
    He whispers to your heart, turn not away,
    For He's beside you, in your narrow pew;
    If you will listen, you will hear Him say 
    In loving tones "Beloved, 'twas for you."  [Chorus]
