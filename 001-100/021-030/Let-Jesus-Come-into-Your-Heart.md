    1.
    If you are tired of the load of your sin,
    Let Jesus come into your heart;
    If you desire a new life to begin,
    Let Jesus come into your heart.

    Chorus:
    Just now, your doubtings give o'er;
    Just now, reject Him no more;
    Just now, throw open the door;
    Let Jesus come into your heart.

    2.
    If 'tis for purity now that you sigh,
    Let Jesus come into your heart;
    Fountains for cleansing are flowing near by,
    Let Jesus come into your heart.  [Chorus]

    3.
    If there's a tempest your voice cannot still,
    Let Jesus come into your heart;
    If there's a void this world never can fill,
    Let Jesus come into your heart.  [Chorus]

    4.
    If friends, once trusted, have proven untrue,
    Let Jesus come into your heart;
    Find what a Friend He will be unto you.
    Let Jesus come into your heart.  [Chorus]

    5.
    If you would join the glad songs of the blest,
    Let Jesus come into your heart:
    If you would enter the mansions of rest,
    Let Jesus come into your heart.

    Chorus:
    Just now, my doubtings are o'er; 
    Just now, rejecting no more;
    Just now, I open the door,
    And Jesus comes into my heart.
