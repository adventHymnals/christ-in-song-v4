    1.
    I cannot drive the nails again,
    I cannot thrust the spear of pain,
    I cannot bear to see His grief and agony,
    Repeating Calvary 
    By tho't of sin,
    Repeating Calvary  
    By tho't of sin.

    2.
    'Twas sin alone that nailed Him there,
    'Twas love alone that made Him bear;
    Sin's wage of death, our due,
    Upon himself He drew
    That we may live anew,
    His glory share,
    That we may live anew, 
    His glory share.

    3.
    His power frees from fetters strong,
    All who confess and turn from wrong:
    He could have shunned the pain.
    Sin's pow'r would yet remain:
    Now law and pardon reign, 
    The angels' song, 
    Now law and pardon reign, 
    The angels' song.

    4.
    My soul abhors His murd'rer sin,
    No longer shall He dwell within;
    But Christ, the living law,
    Victor in holy war,
    Enthroned forevermore,
    Gives pow'r to win,
    Enthroned forevermore,
    Gives pow'r to win.
