    1.
    Ring the bells of heaven!  there is joy today,
    For a soul, returning from the wild;
    See!  the Father meets him out upon the way,
    Welcoming His weary, wand'ring child.

    Chorus:
    Glory!  glory!  how the angels sing;
    Glory!  glory!  how the loud harps ring;
    'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea,
    Pealing forth the anthem of the free.

    2.
    Ring the bells of heaven!  there is joy today,
    For the wanderer now is reconciled;
    Yes, a soul is rescued from his sinful way,
    And is born a new a ransomed child.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Ring the bells of heaven!  spread the feast today,
    Angels, swell the glad triumphant strain.
    Tell the joyful tidings!  bear it far away!
    For a precious soul is born again.  [Chorus]
