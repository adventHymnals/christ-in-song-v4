    1.
    Sin it o'er and o'er again,
    Glorious message, clear and plain;
    'Tis today the same as then,
    Christ receiveth sinful men.

    Chorus:
    Wonderful word, O sweet refrain!
    Christ receives sinful men
    Message of mercy, clear and plain,
    Christ receiveth sinful men.

    2.
    "Seek and find," and "look and live;" 
    Grace is free!  proclaim to all
    Who the heav'nly pathway leave,
    All who linger, all who fall.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Years of sin condemn us not,
    Pure before the law we stand;
    Jesus' blood removes each spot,
    Satisfies its full demand.  [Chorus]

    4.
    He will take the sinfulest,
    Make the scarlet white and pure;
    Come, and he will give you rest;
    Trust his word, forever sure.  [Chorus]

    5.
    In Thy righteous robe to shine,
    Lord, I come, and rest forgiv'n;
    Self is love in love divine,
    Death in life, and earth in heav'n.  [Chorus]
