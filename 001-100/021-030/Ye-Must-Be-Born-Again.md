    1.
    A ruler once came to Jesus by night,
    To ask Him the way of salvation and light;
    The Master made answer in words true and plain,
    "Ye must be born again."

    Chorus:
    "Ye must be born again,
    Ye must be born again,
    I verily, verily, say unto thee,
    Ye must be born again.

    2.
    Ye children of men, attend to the word
    So solemnly uttered by Jesus the Lord,
    And let not this message to you be in vain,
    "Ye must be born again." [Chorus]

    3.
    O ye who would enter that glorious rest,
    And sing with the ransom'd the song of the blest,
    The life everlasting if you would obtain,
    "Ye must be born again."  [Chorus]
