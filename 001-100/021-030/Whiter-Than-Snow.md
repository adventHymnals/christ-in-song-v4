    1.
    Blessed be the Fountain of blood,
    To a world of sinners revealed;
    Blessed be the dear Son of God;
    Only by his stripes we are healed.
    Tho' I've wandered far from his fold,
    Bringing to my heart pain and woe,
    Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
    And I shall be whiter than snow.

    Chorus:
    Whiter than the snow,
    Whiter than the snow,
    Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
    And I shall be whiter than snow.

    2.
    Thorny was the crown that he wore,
    And the cross his body o'er came;
    Grievous were the sorrows he bore,
    But he suffered thus not in vain.
    May I to the Fountain be led,
    Made to cleanse my sins here below;
    Wash me in the blood that he shed,
    And I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Father, I have wandered from thee,
    Often has my heart gone astray:
    Crimson do my sins seem to me,
    Water cannot wash them away.
    Jesus, to that Fountain of thine,
    Leaning on thy promise I go;
    Cleanse me by thy washing divine,
    And I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]
