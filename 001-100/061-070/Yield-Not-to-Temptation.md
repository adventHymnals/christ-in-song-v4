    1.
    Yield not to temptation,
    For yielding is sin,
    Each vict'ry will help you
    Some other to win;
    Fight manfully onward,
    Dark passions subdue.
    Look ever to Jesus,
    He'll carry you through.

    Chorus:
    Ask the Saviour to help you,
    Comfort, strengthen, and keep you;
    He is willing to aid you,
    He will carry you through.

    2.
    Shun evil companions,
    Bad language disdain,
    God's name hold in rev'rence,
    Nor take it in vain;
    Be thoughtful and earnest,
    Kindhearted and true,
    Look ever to Jesus, 
    He'll carry you through.  [Chorus]

    3.
    To him that o'ercometh,
    God giveth a crown,
    Through faith we shall conquer,
    Tho' often cast down;
    He who is our Saviour,
    Our strength will renew.
    Look ever to Jesus,
    He'll carry you through.  [Chorus]
