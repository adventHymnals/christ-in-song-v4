    1.
    I think when I read that sweet story of old,
    When Jesus was here among men,
    How he call'd little children as lambs to his fold,
    I should like to have been with them then.
    I wish that his hands had been placed on my head,
    That his arm had been thrown around me,
    And that I might have seen his kind look when he said,
    "Let the little ones come unto me."

    Yet still is the Saviour in pray'r I may go,
    And ask for a share in his love,
    And if I thus earnestly seek him below,
    I shall see him and hear him above.
    In that beautiful plan he has gone to prepare
    For all who are wash'd and forgiv'n,
    Oh, may we at last find a glad welcome there,
    Safe at home in the kingdom of heav'n.
