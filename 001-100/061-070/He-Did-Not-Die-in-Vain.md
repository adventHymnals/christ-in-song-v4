    1.
    My blessed Lord was crucified;
    The day was dark and grief was wide;
    For hope was crushed, and all seemed vain,
    Until the Saviour rose again.

    Refrain:
    Ring out the blessed news again!
    Oh!  bear aloft the strain;
    The mighty Lord is risen in pow'r;
    He died, but not in vain.

    2.
    He brings His great salvation nigh,
    And on His love bids us rely;
    He bought our peace thro'grief and pain
    But oh!  He did not die in vain.  [Refrain]

    3.
    O, wondrous news of life and love!
    That Jesus lives and reigns above;
    He made the path of glory plain;
    Ah, no!  He did not die in vain.  [Refrain]
