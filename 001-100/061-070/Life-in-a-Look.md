    1.
    There's life in a look at the sacred cross,
    Jesus has said, "Look unto me;"
    Earth with its riches is only dross,
    Bright treasures beyond in the cross I see.

    Chorus:
    In a look there's life for thee,
    In a look at Calvary;
    Blessed thought, Salvation free,
    By a look at Calvary.

    2.
    When first to the Saviour I raised my eyes,
    Sweet was the smile that fell on me;
    Oft as the clouds of temptation rise,
    A look at the cross still my strength shall be.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I'll look to the cross ev'ry day and hour,
    Trusting the promise God has given;
    None ever fall neath the tempter's pow'r,
    Who trust and obey in the strength of Heav'n.  [Chorus]
