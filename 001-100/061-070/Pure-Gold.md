    1.
    Why labor for treasures that rust and decay,
    That sparkle a moment, then vanish away?
    Go rather to Jesus, with earnest desire,
    And buy of him "gold that is tried in the fire;"
    Salvation's a treasure of value untold;
    Be wise to obtain it, for this is PURE GOLD.

    2.
    Each promise contain'd in the Book he has giv'n,
    Directing the soul in its pathway to heav'n,
    Is priceless, eternal, unbounded, and free,
    More precious than diamonds, or gems of the sea;
    God's word is a treasure of value untold;
    O fail not to gain it, for this is PURE GOLD.

    3.
    The gift of the Spirit, which all may receive
    The rapture of pardon to all who believe
    An answer to pray'r when the heart is oppress'd
    The hope of a crown, and a mansion of rest
    All these are bright treasures of value untold;
    Make haste to secure them for they are PURE GOLD.
