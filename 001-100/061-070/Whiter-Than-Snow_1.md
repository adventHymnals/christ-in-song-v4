    1.
    Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole;
    I want thee forever, to live in my soul;
    Break down ev'ry idol, cast out ev'ry foe;
    Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

    Chorus:
    Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow;
    Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

    2.
    Lord Jesus, look down from thy throne in the skies,
    And help me to make a complete sacrifice;
    I give up myself, and whatever I know;
    Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;
    I wait, blessed Lord, at thy crucified feet,
    By faith,for my cleansing, I see thy blood flow; 
    Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Lord Jesus, thou seest I patiently wait;
    Come now, and within me a new heart create;
    To those who have sought thee, then never said'st No;
    Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  [Chorus]
