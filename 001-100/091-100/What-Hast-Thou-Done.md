    1.
    I gave my life for Thee,
    My precious blood I shed,
    That Thou might'st ransom'd be,
    And quicken'd from the dead,
    I gave, I gave my life for Thee,
    What has thou giv'n for me?
    I gave, I gave my life for Thee,
    What hast Thou giv'n for me?

    2.
    My Father's house of light,
    My glory circled throne,
    I left for earthly night,
    For wand'rings sad and lone;
    I left, I left it all for Thee,
    Hast Thou left aught for me?
    I left, I left it all for Thee,
    Hast Thou left aught for me?

    3.
    I suffered much for Thee,
    More than Thy tongue can tell,
    Of bitt'rest agony,
    To rescue Thee from hell;
    I've borne, I've borne it all for Thee,
    What hast Thou borne for me?
    I've borne, I've borne it all for Thee,
    What hast Thou borne for me?
