    1.
    Not saved are we by trying,
    From self can come no aid;
    'Tis on the blood relying,
    Once for our ransom paid;
    'Tis looking unto Jesus,
    The holy One and just;
    'Tis His great work that saves us,
    It is not Try, but Trust.

    Chorus:  It is not Try, but Trust,
    It is not Try, but Trust; 
    'Tis His great work that saves us;
    It is not Try, but Trust.

    2.
    'Twas vain for Israel bitten
    By serpents on their way,
    To look to their own doing,
    That awful plague to stay;
    The remedy and healing,
    When humbled in the dust,
    Was of the Lord's revealing,
    It is not Try, but Trust.  [Chorus]

    3.
    No deeds of ours are needed
    To make Christ's merit more;
    No frames of mind, or feelings,
    Can add to His great store;
    'Tis simply to receive Him,
    The holy One and just,
    'Tis only to believe Him,
    It is not Try, but Trust.  [Chorus]
