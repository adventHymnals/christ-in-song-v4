    1.
    Weeping will not save me
    Tho' my face were bathed in tears,
    That could not allay my fears,
    Could not wash the sins of years
    Weeping will not save me.

    Refrain:
    Jesus wept and died for me;
    Jesus suffered on the tree;
    Jesus waits to make me free;
    He alone can save me.

    2.
    Working will not save me
    Purest deeds that I can do,
    Holiest thoughts and feelings, too,
    Can not form my soul anew
    Working will not save me.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Waiting will not save me
    Helpless, guilty, lost I lie,
    In my ear is mercy's cry;
    If I wail I can but die
    Waiting will not save me.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Faith in Christ will save me
    Let me trust thy weeping Son,
    Trust the work that he has done;
    To his arms, Lord, help me run
    Faith in Christ will save me.  [Refrain]
