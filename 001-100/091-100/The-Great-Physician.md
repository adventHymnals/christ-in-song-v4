    1.
    The great Physician now is near,
    The sympathizing Jesus;
    He speaks, the drooping heart to cheer,
    O hear the voice of Jesus!

    Chorus:
    Sweetest note in seraph song,
    Sweetest name on mortal tongue,
    Sweetest carol ever sung,
    Jesus, blessed Jesus!

    2.
    Your many sins are all forgiv'n,
    O hear the voice of Jesus;
    Go on your way in peace to heav'n,
    And wear a crown with Jesus.   [Chorus]

    3.
    All glory to the dying Lamb!
    I now believe in Jesus;
    I love the blessed Saviour's name,
    I love the name of Jesus.  [Chorus]

    4.
    His name dispels my guilt and fear;
    No other name but Jesus;
    O how my soul delights to hear
    The precious name of Jesus!  [Chorus]

    5.
    And when he comes to bring the crown,
    The crown of life and glory;
    Then by his side we will sit down,
    And tell redemption's story.  [Chorus]
