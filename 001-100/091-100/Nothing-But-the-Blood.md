    1.
    What can wash away my sin?
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
    What can make me pure within?
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

    Refrain:
    Oh, precious is the flow
    That makes me white as snow;
    No other fount I know,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

    2.
    For my cleansing this I see
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
    For my pardon this my plea
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Nothing can for sin atone
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
    Naught of good that I have done
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  [Refrain]

    4.
    This is all my hope and peace
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
    This is all my righteousness
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  [Refrain]

    5.
    Glory!  glory!  thus I sing
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
    All my praise for this I bring
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  [Refrain]
