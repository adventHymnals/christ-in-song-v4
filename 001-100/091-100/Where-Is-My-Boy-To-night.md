    1.
    Where is my wand'ring boy to-night
    The boy of my tenderest care,
    The boy that was once my joy and light,
    The child of my love and prayer?

    Chorus:
    O where is my boy to-night?
    O where is my boy to-night?
    My heart o'erflows, for I love him, he knows;
    O where is my boy to-night?

    2.
    Once he was pure as morning dew,
    As he knelt at his mother's knee;
    No face was so bright, no heart more true,
    And none was so sweet as he.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O could I see you now, my boy,
    As fair as is olden time,
    When prattle and smile made home a joy,
    And life was a merry chime;  [Chorus]

    4.
    Go for my wand'ring boy to-night;
    Go, search for him where you will;
    But bring him to me with all his blight,
    And tell him I love him still.  [Chorus]
