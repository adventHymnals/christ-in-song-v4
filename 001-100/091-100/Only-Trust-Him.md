    1.
    Come, ev'ry soul by sin oppressed,
    There's mercy with the Lord,
    And he will surely give you rest,
    By trusting in his word.

    Chorus:
    Only trust him, only trust him,
    Only trust him now;
    He will save you, he will save you,
    He will save you now.

    2.
    For Jesus shed his precious blood
    Rich blessings to bestow;
    Plunge now into the crimson flood
    That washes white as snow.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Yes, Jesus is the Truth, the Way,
    That Leads you into rest;
    Believe in him without delay,
    And you are fully blest.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Come, then, and join this holy band,
    And on to glory go,
    To dwell in that celestial land,
    Where joys immortal flow.  [Chorus]
