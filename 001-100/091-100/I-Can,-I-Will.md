    1.
    Refining fire, go thro' my heart,
    Refining fire, go thro' my heart,
    Refining fire, go thro' my heart,
    Illuminate my soul.

    Chorus No. 1:
    I can, I will, I do believe,
    I can, I will, I do believe,
    I can, I will, I do believe,
    That Jesus saves me now.

    Chorus No. 2:
    I'm kneeling at the mercy seat,
    I'm kneeling at the mercy seat,
    I'm kneeling at the mercy seat,
    Where Jesus answers pray'r.

    2.
    Scatter Thy life thro' ev'ry part,
    Scatter Thy life, thro' ev'ry part,
    Scatter Thy life, thro' ev'ry part,
    And sanctify the whole.

    3.
    Oh, that it now from heav'n might fall,
    Oh, that it now from heav'n might fall,
    Oh, that it now from heav'n might fall,
    And all my sins consume.

    4.
    Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call,
    Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call,
    Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call,
    Spirit of burning, come.
