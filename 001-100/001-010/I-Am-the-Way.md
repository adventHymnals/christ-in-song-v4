    1.
    Like wand'ring sheep o'er mountains cold,
    Since all have gone astray;
    To "Life" and peace within the fold,
    How may I find the way?

    Chorus:
    I am the way, the truth, and the life:
    No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.
    I am the way, I am the way, 
    I am the way, the truth, and the life;
    No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

    2.
    Bewildered oft with doubt and care,
    To God I fain would go;
    While many cry "Lo here!  lo there!"
    The Truth how may I know?  [Chorus]

    3.
    To Christ the Way, the Truth, the Life,
    I come, no more to roam;
    He'll guide me to my "Father's house,
    To my eternal home.  [Chorus]
