    1.
    In the land of strangers,
    Whither thou art gone,
    Hear a far voice calling,
    "My son!  my son!"

    Chorus:
    "Welcome!  wand'rer, welcome!
    Welcome back to home!
    Thou hast wandered far away;
    Come home!  come home!"

    2.
    "From the land of hunger,
    Fainting, famished, lone,
    Come to love and gladness,
    My son!  my son!  [Chorus]

    3.
    "Leave the haunts of riot,
    Wasted, woe be gone,
    Sick at heart and weary,
    My son!  my son!  [Chorus]

    4.
    "See the door still open!  
    Thou art still my own;
    Eyes of love are on thee,
    My son!  my son!  [Chorus]

    5.
    "Far off thou hast wandered;
    Wilt thou farther roam?
    Come, and all is pardoned,
    My son!  my son!  [Chorus]

    6.
    "See the well-spread table,
    Unforgotten one!
    Here is rest and plenty,
    My son!  my son!  [Chorus]

    7.
    "Thou art friendless, homeless,
    Hopeless, and undone;
    Mine is love unchanging,
    My son!  my son!"  [Chorus]
