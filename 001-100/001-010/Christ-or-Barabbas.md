[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yw1rTFY%2DTRtWctouHtuFX7bHeiDRB%2DSg/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    What shall I do with Jesus?
    He stands before me now,
    Wearing the robe of purple,
    And thorns upon His brow.

    Refrain:
    This is the question now;
    What shall the answer be?
    Shall I crucify King Jesus,
    And set Barabbas free?

    2.
    Shall I release the robber,
    The carnal man of pride?
    Sin or a sinless Saviour?--
    O which shall be denied?

    Refrain:
    This is the question now;
    What shall the answer be?
    Shall I crucify King Jesus,
    And set Barabbas free?

    3.
    Solemn and awful question!  
    How still the balance stands!
    Mercy a moment lingers,
    It trembles in her hands.

    Refrain:
    This is the question now;
    What shall the answer be?
    Shall I crucify King Jesus,
    And set Barabbas free?

    4.
    Self on the seat of judgment,
    Dare you the world deny?
    Louder and louder calling,
    "Away!"  and "Crucify!"

    Refrain:
    This is the question now;
    What shall the answer be?
    Shall I crucify King Jesus,
    And set Barabbas free?

    5.
    Not to the sinner only,
    The question comes with pow'r;
    Hear it, ye halting Christians,
    In ev'ry trial hour.

    Refrain:
    This is the question now;
    What shall the answer be?
    I will crucify Barabbas,
    And set King Jesus free.
