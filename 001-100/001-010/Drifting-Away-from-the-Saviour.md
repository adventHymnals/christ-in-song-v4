    1.
    Drifting away from the Saviour,
    Casting reproach on the Lord;
    Drifting away from His temple,
    Heeding no longer His word.

    Refrain:
    Drifting away, drifting away,
    Drifting away from the Saviour,
    Drifting, still drifting away.

    2.
    Drifting away from the Saviour,
    Slighting and grieving His love;
    Drifting away from the mansions
    He is preparing above.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Drifting away from the Saviour, 
    Lonely and helpless thou art;
    Drifting away from His people,
    Ever so dear to His heart.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Drifting away from the Saviour,
    He who has showed you the way;
    Drifting away from His teaching,
    Farther and farther each day.  [Refrain]

    5.
    Drifting away from the Saviour,
    Still He is mindful of thee.
    Come unto Him and believing,
    Pardon'd thro' grace thou shalt be.  [Refrain]
