    1.
    Jesus is tenderly calling thee home
    Calling today, calling today;
    Why from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam
    Farther and farther away?

    Refrain:
    Calling today,
    calling today;
    Jesus is calling,
    is tenderly calling today.

    2.
    Jesus is calling the weary to rest
    Calling today, calling today;
    Bring Him thy burden, and thou shalt be blest;
    He will not turn thee away.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Jesus is waiting, oh, come to Him now
    Waiting today, waiting today;
    Come with thy sins, at His feet lowly bow;
    Come, and no longer delay.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Jesus is pleading, oh, list to His voice
    Hear Him today,
    hear Him to-day;
    They who believ on His name shall rejoice;
    Quickly arise and away.  [Refrain]
