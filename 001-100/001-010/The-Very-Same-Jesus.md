    1.
    Come, sinners, to the Living One,
    He's just the same Jesus
    As when He raised the widow's son,
    The very same Jesus.

    Chorus:
    The very same Jesus,
    The wonder working Jesus:
    O praise His name!
    He's just the same,
    The very same Jesus.

    2.
    Come, feast upon the "living bread,"
    He's just the same Jesus
    As when the multitudes He fed,
    The very same Jesus.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Come, tell Him all your griefs and fears,
    He's just the same Jesus
    As when He shed those loving tears,
    The very same Jesus.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Come unto Him for clearer light,
    He's just the same Jesus
    As when He gave the blind their sight,
    The very same Jesus.  [Chorus]

    5.
    Calm 'midst the waves of trouble be,
    He's just the same Jesus
    As when He hush'd the raging sea,
    The very same Jesus.  [Chorus]

    6.
    Some day our raptured eyes shall see
    He's just the same Jesus;
    O blessed day for you and me!
    The very same Jesus.  [Chorus]
