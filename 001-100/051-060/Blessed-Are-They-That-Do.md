    1.
    Hear the words our Saviour hath spoken,
    Words of life, unfailing and true;
    Careless one, prayerless one, hear and remember,
    Jesus says, "Blessed are they that do."

    Chorus:
    Blessed are they that do his commandments,
    Blessed are they, blessed are they;
    Blessed are they that do his commandments,
    Blessed, blessed, blessed are they.

    2.
    All in vain we hear his commandments,
    All in vain his promises, too;
    Hearing them, fearing them, never can save us,
    Blessed, O blessed are they that do.  [Chorus]

    3.
    They with joy may enter the city,
    Free from sin, from sorrow and strife,
    Sanctified, glorified, now and forever,
    They may have right to the tree of life.  [Chorus]
