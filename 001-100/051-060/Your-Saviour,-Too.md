    1.
    I have a Saviour, he's pleading in glory,
    A dear, loving Saviour, tho' earth friends be few;
    And now he is watching in tenderness o'er me,
    And O that my Saviour were your Saviour too!

    Chorus:
    Your Saviour, too,
    Your Saviour, too;
    My Saviour bids me tell you,
    He's your Saviour, too

    2.
    I have a Father to me he has given
    A hope for eternity, blessed and true;
    And soon will he call me to meet him in heaven,
    But O that I might hear him welcome you too!  [Chorus]

    3.
    A robe fair and spotless, resplendent in whiteness,
    Is waiting in glory my wondering view;
    And when I receive it all shining in brightness,
    Dear friend, I would see you receiving one too!  [Chorus]

    4.
    To me has been given a peace like a river
    A peace that the friends of this world never knew;
    And Christ is the Author, and Christ is the Giver,
    And O that his peace might be given to you!  [Chorus]

    5.
    When Jesus has found you, tell others the story,
    That my loving Saviour is your Saviour too;
    Then pray that your Saviour may bring them to glory,
    And prayer will be answered 'twas answered for you!  [Chorus]
