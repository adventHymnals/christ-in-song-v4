    1.
    All to Jesus I surrender,
    All to Him I freely give;
    I will ever love and trust Him,
    In His presence daily live;

    Chorus:
    I surrender all,
    I surrender all;
    All to Thee, my blessed Saviour,
    I surrender all.

    2.
    All to Jesus I surrender,
    Humbly at His feet I bow;
    Worldly pleasures all forsaken,
    Take me, Jesus, take me now;  [Chorus]

    3.
    All to Jesus I surrender,
    Make me, Saviour, wholly Thine;
    Let me feel the Holy Spirit,
    Truly know that Thou art mine;  [Chorus]

    4.
    All to Jesus I surrender,
    Now I feel the sacred flame,
    O the joy of full salvation!
    Glory, glory to His name!  [Chorus]
