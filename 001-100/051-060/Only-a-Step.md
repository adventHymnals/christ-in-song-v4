    1.
    Only a step to Jesus!
    Then why not take it now?
    Come, and thy sin confessing,
    To Him thy Saviour bow.

    Chorus:
    Only a step, only a step;
    Come, He waits for thee,
    Come, and thy sin confessing,
    Thou shalt receive a blessing;
    Do not reject the mercy
    He freely offers thee.

    2.
    Only a step to Jesus!
    Believe and thou shalt live;
    Lovingly now He's waiting,
    And ready to forgive.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Only a step to Jesus!
    A step from sin to grace;
    What has thy heart decided?
    The moments fly apace.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Only a step to Jesus!
    O why not come, and say,
    Gladly to thee, my Saviour,
    I gave myself away.  [Chorus]
