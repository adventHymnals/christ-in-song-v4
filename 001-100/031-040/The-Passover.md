    1.
    The day is dead, and Egypt's night returning,
    Is dark and still in death's prophetic gloom.
    The world sleeps on, but Israel's lamp is burning;
    At midnight sounds the' oppressor's note of doom.

    Refrain:
    "I will pass over you, when I see the blood:"
    I will pass over you, 'tis a saving flood.
    "I will pass over you, when I see the blood,"
    The precious blood of Jesus. 

    2.
    The Lamb is slain, the Sacrifice immortal,
    Whose life received creates the soul anew;
    His blood is shed, but is it on the portal?
    O haste and see!  doth it avail for you?  [Refrain]

    3.
    Not there?  not there?  no crimson on the lintel?
    Delay!  delay!  O thou destroying One!
    Give grace?  give grace!  it must be more than mental:
    My heart!  my heart!  let there thy work be done.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Art safe, my soul!  rest not in thy salvation,
    Else thou art not like Him who came to die;
    In love go forth with mercy's invitation,
    Awake the world!  death's angel passes by.  [Refrain]
