    1.
    We'll build on the Rock, the living rock,
    On Jesus, the Rock of Ages;
    So shall we abide the fearful shock,
    When loud the tempest rages.

    Chorus:
    We'll build on the Rock,
    We'll build on the Rock;
    We'll build on the Rock, on the solid Rock,
    On Christ, the mighty Rock.

    2.
    Some build on the sinking sands of life,
    On visions of earthly treasure;
    Some build on the waves of sin and strife,
    Of fame, and worldly pleasure.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O build on the Rock, forever sure,
    The firm and the true foundation;
    Its hope is the hope which shall endure,
    The hope of our salvation.  [Chorus]
