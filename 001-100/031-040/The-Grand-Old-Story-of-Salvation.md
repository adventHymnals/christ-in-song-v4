    1.
    We tell it as we journey t'ward the mansions built above,
    The grand old story of salvation;
    We sing it out with gladness, in the melodies of love,
    The grand old story of salvation.

    Chorus:
    Ring it out, ring it out,
    Ring, to ev'ry tribe and nation,
    Ring it out, ring it out,
    The grand old story of salvation.

    2.
    His hand can lift the fallen and His blood can make them white,
    The grand old story of salvation;
    His love can pierce the darkness with a never-fading light,
    The grand old story of salvation.  [Chorus]

    3.
    We'll sing it in the battle for its notes are victory,
    The grand old story of salvation;
    We'll sing it in our trials, till the passing shadows flee,
    The grand old story of salvation.  [Chorus]

    4.
    The angels look with wonder, yet their harps can never tell,
    The grand old story of salvation;
    His ransomed, cloth'd with beauty, shall the praise of Jesus swell, 
    The grand old story of salvation.  [Chorus]
