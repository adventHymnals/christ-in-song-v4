    1.
    'Twas in the days of careless youth, when life was fair and bright,
    And ne'er a tear, and scarce a fear o'ercast my day and night,
    As in the quiet eventide, I pass'd her kneeling there,
    That just one word, my name, I heard my name in mother's pray'r.

    Chorus:
    My name in mother's pray'r.
    My name in mother's pray'r.
    That just one word, my name I heard.
    I heard my name in mother's pray'r.

    2.
    I thought but little of it then, tho' rev'rence touch'd my heart,
    To her whose love sought from above for me the better part;
    But when life's sterner battles came with many a subtle snare,
    Oft that one word, in thought I heard my name in mother's pray'r.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I wandered on, and heeded not God's oft repeated call
    To turn from sin, to live for Him, and trust to Him my all;
    But when at last, convinced of sin, I sank in deep despair,
    My hope awoke, when mem'ry spoke my name in mother's pray'r.  [Chorus]

    4.
    That pleading heart, that soul so tried, has gone into her rest,
    But still with me for aye shall be the mem'ry of her trust,
    And when I cross the Jordan's tide, and meet her over there,
    We'll praise the Lord, who bless'd that word, my name in mother's pray'r.  [Chorus]
