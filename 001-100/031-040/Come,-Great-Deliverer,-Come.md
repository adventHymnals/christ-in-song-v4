    1.
    O hear my cry, be gracious now to me,
    Come, Great Deliv'rer, come;
    My soul bowed down is longing now for Thee,
    Come, Great Deliv'rer, come.

    Refrain:
    I've wander'd far away o'er mountains cold,
    I've wander'd far away from home;
    O take me now, and bring me to Thy fold,
    Come, Great Deliv'rer, come

    2.
    I have no place, no shelter from the night,
    Come, Great Deliv'rer, come;
    One look from Thee would give me life and light,
    Come, Great Deliv'rer, come.  [Refrain]

    3.
    My path is lone, and weary are my feet,
    Come, Great Deliv'rer, come;
    Mine eyes look up Thy loving smile to meet,
    Come, Great Deliv'rer, come,  [Refrain]

    4.
    Thou wilt not spurn contrition's broken sigh,
    Come, Great Deliv'rer, come;
    Regard my prayer, and hear my humble cry,
    Come, Great Deliv'rer, come.  [Refrain]
