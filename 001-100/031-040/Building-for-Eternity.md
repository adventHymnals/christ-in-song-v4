    1.
    We are building in sorrow or joy
    A temple the world may not see,
    Which time cannot mar nor destroy:
    We build for eternity.

    Chorus:
    We are building, ev'ry day,
    A temple the world may not see;
    Building, building ev'ry day,
    Building for eternity!

    2.
    Ev'ry tho't that we've ever had,
    Its own little place has fill'd;
    Ev'ry deed we have done, good or bad,
    Is a stone in the temple we build.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Ev'ry word that so lightly falls,
    Giving some heart joy or pain,
    Will shine in our temple wall,
    Or ever its beauty stain.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Are you building for God alone?
    Are you building in faith and love,
    A temple the Father will own,
    In the city of light above?  [Chorus]
