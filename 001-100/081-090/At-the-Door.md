    1.
    The mistakes of my life are many,
    The sins of my heart are more,
    And I scarce can see for weeping,
    But I knock at the open door.

    Chorus:
    I know I am weak and sinful,
    It comes to me more and more;
    But since the dear Saviour has bid me come in,
    I'll enter the open door.

    2.
    I am lowest of those who love Him,
    I am weakest of those who pray;
    But I come as He has bidden,
    And He will not say me nay.  [Chorus]

    3.
    My mistakes His free grace will cover,
    My sins He will wash away,
    And the feet that shrink and falter,
    Shall walk thro' the gates of day.  [Chorus]
