    1.
    Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing pow'r?
    Are you wash'd in the blood of the Lamb?
    Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour?
    Are you wash'd in the blood of the Lamb?

    Chorus:
    Are you wash'd in the blood,
    In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?
    Are your garments spotless, are they white as snow?
    Are you wash'd in the blood of the Lamb?

    2.
    Are you walking daily by the Saviour's side?
    Are you wash'd in the blood of the Lamb?
    Do you rest each moment in the Crucified?
    Are you wash'd in the blood of the Lamb?  [Chorus]

    3.
    When the bridegroom cometh will your robes be white,
    Pure, and wash'd in the blood of the Lamb?
    Will your soul be ready for the mansions bright,
    And be wash'd in the blood of the Lamb?  [Chorus]

    4.
    Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin,
    And be wash'd in the blood of the Lamb?
    There's a fountain flowing for the soul unclean,
    O be wash'd in the blood of the Lamb!  [Chorus]
