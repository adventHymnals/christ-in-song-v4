    1.
    Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,
    Hear my humble cry,
    While on others Thou art calling,
    Do not pass me by.

    Chorus:
    Saviour, Saviour,
    hear my humble cry,
    While on others Thou art calling,
    Do not pass me by.

    2.
    Let me at the throne of mercy
    Find a sweet relief;
    Kneeling there in deep contrition,
    Help my unbelief.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Trusting only in Thy merit,
    Would I seek Thy face;
    Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
    Save me by Thy grace?  [Chorus]

    4.
    Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
    More than life to me;
    Whom have I on earth beside thee!
    Whom in heav'n but Thee?  [Chorus]
