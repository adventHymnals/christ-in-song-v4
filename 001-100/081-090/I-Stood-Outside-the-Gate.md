    1.
    I stood outside the gate,
    A poor, wayfaring child:
    Within my heart there beat
    A tempest loud and wild;
    A fear oppressed my soul,
    That I might be too late;
    And oh, I trembled sore,
    And pray'd outside the gate,
    And pray'd outside the gate.

    2.
    "O Mercy!" loud I cried,
    "Now give me rest from sin!"
    "I will," a voice replied;
    And Mercy let me in;
    She bound my bleeding wounds,
    And soothed my heart, opprest;
    She washed away my guilt
    And gave me peace and rest,
    And gave me peace and rest. 

    3.
    In Mercy's guise I knew
    The Saviour long abused,
    Who often sought my heart,
    And wept when I refused;
    Oh!  what a blest return
    For all my years of sin!
    I stood outside the gate,
    And Jesus let me in,
    And Jesus let me in,
