    1.
    There's a great day coming,
    A great day coming,
    There's a great day coming by and by,
    When the saints and the sinners shall be parted right and left
    Are you ready for that day to come?

    Chorus:
    Are you ready?
    Are you ready?
    Are you ready for the judgment day?
    Are you ready?
    Are you ready?  
    for the judgment day?

    2.
    There's a bright day coming,
    A bright day coming,
    There's a bright day coming by and by,
    But its brightness shall only come to them that love the Lord,
    Are you ready for that day to come?  [Chorus]

    3.
    There's a sad day coming,
    A sad day coming,
    There's a sad day coming by and by,
    When the sinner shall hear his doom "Depart, I know ye not,"
    Are you ready for that day to come?  [Chorus]
