    1.
    Jesus, the loving Shepherd,
    Calleth thee now to come
    Into the fold of safety,
    Where there is rest and room;
    Come in the strength of manhood,
    Come in the morn of youth,
    Enter the fold of safety,
    Enter the way of truth.

    Chorus: 
    Lovingly, tenderly calling is he;
    Wanderer, wanderer, come unto me,
    Patiently standing there, waiting,
    I See Jesus my Shepherd divine.

    2.
    Jesus, the loving Shepherd,
    Gave his dear life for thee,
    Tenderly now he's calling,
    Wanderer, come to me;
    Haste, for without is danger,
    Come, cries the Shepherd blest,
    Enter the fold of safety,
    Enter the place of rest.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Lingering is but folly,
    Wolves are abroad today,
    Seeking the sheep now straying,
    Seeking the lambs to stay;
    Jesus, the loving Shepherd,
    Calleth thee now to come
    Into the fold of safety,
    When there is rest and room.  [Chorus]
