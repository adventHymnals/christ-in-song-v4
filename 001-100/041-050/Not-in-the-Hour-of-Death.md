    1.
    Not in the hour of death,
    Not when the pulse is low,
    Not with the failing breath,
    Not when you fear to go;

    Refrain:
    Come to Him now, come.
    Come to Him now.
    Jesus can save,
    O come to him now;
    Jesus will save,
    O come to him now.

    2.
    Not when the frost of time 
    Has changed the gold to gray;
    Come in the golden prime
    Of manhood's summer day.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Not when the noon of care
    Has robbed the flow'rs of dew;
    Come in the morning fair,
    Of life's glad springtime new.  [Refrain]
