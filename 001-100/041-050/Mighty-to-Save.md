    1.
    O who is this that cometh
    From Edom's crimson plain,
    With wounded side, with garments dyed?
    O tell me now thy name.
    "I that saw thy soul's distress,
    A ransom gave;
    I that speak in righteousness,
    Mighty to save."

    Refrain:
    Mighty to save,
    Mighty to save,
    Mighty to save;
    Lord, I trust thy wondrous love,
    Mighty to save.

    2.
    O why is thine apparel
    With reeking gore all dyed,
    Like them that tread the winepress red?
    O why this bloody tide?
    I the wine-press trod alone, 
    "Neath dark'ning skies;
    Of the people there was none
    Mighty to save."  [Chorus]

    3.
    O bleeding Lamb, my Saviour!
    How could'st thou bear this shame?
    "With mercy fraught, mine own arm brought
    Salvation in my name;
    I the bloody fight have won,
    Conquer'd the grave,
    Now the year of joy has come,
    Mighty to save."  [Chorus]
