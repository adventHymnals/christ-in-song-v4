    1.
    There's room for you to anchor
    Within the port of rest,
    Where tempests all are over,
    And calms no more molest;
    How sweet to weary voyagers
    This precious promise giv'n;
    There's room for you to anchor
    Safe in heaven!

    Refrain:
    There's room, there's room;
    There's room, there's room;
    There's room for you to anchor
    Safe in heav'n.

    2.
    There's room for you to anchor;
    The ship is waiting now,
    The ship of God's preparing,
    O ask not why nor how.
    His boundless love and mercy
    No tongue can ever tell,
    If you but trust his promise,
    All is well.  [Refrain]

    3.
    The same dear friends shall meet us
    That we have loved below;
    The same sweet voices greet us 
    As in the long ago.
    Then hush!  ye murm'ring waters,
    Ye tempests, cease to blow!
    I almost hear the music 
    Soft and low.  [Refrain]

    4.
    O heaving, swelling billows,
    Bear onward to my home!
    Beyond these dreary headlands
    I see its shining dome.
    There, there my fainting spirit
    No more for rest shall sigh;
    'Tis there I hope to anchor,
    By and by.  [Refrain]
