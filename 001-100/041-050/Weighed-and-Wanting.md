    1.
    When the Judge shall weigh our motives,
    For eternal gain or loss,
    Shall we stand as gold before him?
    Or as vile and worthless dross?

    Refrain:
    Weigh'd in the balance of the Lord,
    Weigh'd, weigh'd, and wanting;
    Weigh'd by the standard of his word,
    Weigh'd, weigh'd, and wanting.

    2.
    Shall we hear the glad words spoken:
    "Faithful servant," and "Well done,"
    Or the dread and awful sentence,
    "Thou are wanting," sinful one?  [Refrain]

    3.
    Shall we heed the Spirit's pleading,
    While for mercy we may call,
    Or delay till God's handwriting
    Seals the final doom of all?  [Refrain]
