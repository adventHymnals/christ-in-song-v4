    1.
    I've wandered far away from God,
    Now I'm coming home;
    The paths of sin too long I've trod;
    Lord, I'm coming home.

    Chorus:
    Coming home, coming home
    Nevermore to roam;
    Open wide Thine arms of love;
    Lord, I'm coming home.

    2.
    I've wasted many precious years
    Now I'm coming home;
    I now repent with bitter tears;
    Lord, I'm coming home.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord,
    Now I'm coming home;
    I'll trust Thy love, believe Thy word;
    Lord, I'm coming home.  [Chorus]

    4.
    My only hope, my only plea,
    Now I'm coming home;
    That Jesus died, and died for me;
    Lord, I'm coming home.  [Chorus]

    5.
    I need His cleansing blood I know,
    Now I'm coming home;
    O wash me whiter than the snow;
    Lord' I'm coming home.  [Chorus]
