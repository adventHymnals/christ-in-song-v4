    1.
    "Whosoever heareth," shout, shout the sound!
    Send the blessed tidings all the world around;
    Spread the joyful news wherever man is found:
    "Whosoever will, may come."

    Chorus:
    "Whosoever will, whosoever will,"
    Send the proclamation over vale and hill;
    'Tis a loving Father calls the wand'rer home:
    "Whosoever will, may come."

    2.
    Whosoever cometh need not delay,
    Now the door is open, enter while you may;
    Jesus is the true, the only Living Way:
    "Whosoever will, may come."  [Chorus]

    3.
    "Whosoever will," the promise secure,
    "Whosoever will," for ever must endure;
    "Whosoever will," 'Tis life for evermore:
    "Whosoever will, may come."  [Chorus]
