    1.
    In darkness I lingered 'mid doubt and despair,
    Sin's bondage long held me a captive to care;
    But Jesus delivered my soul from its chains,
    His precious blood cleans'd me from sin's guilty stains.

    Chorus:
    Get right with God!
    His pardon is free,
    Get right with God,
    He's waiting for thee;
    Our Jesus is calling, "Oh, come unto me!"
    Take Him, O sinner, and get right with God.

    2.
    The world and its pleasures did tempt me to stray,
    I saw not the danger that lurk'd on the way;
    The toils clos'd around me, I knew no release,
    But Jesus has found me and giv'n me His peace.  [Chorus]

    3.
    The pathway to Calv'ry is toilsome and hard,
    Yet tread it, O faint me, and find thy reward;
    Here lay down thy burden, and wash in the stream
    That flows like a fountain thy soul to redeem.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Repent while He calls thee, while yet it is day,
    Take with thee His gift of free pardon away;
    Take Christ for thy Saviour, Redeemer, and Friend, His love will sustain thee secure to the end.  [Chorus]
