    1.
    Christ is knocking at my sad heart;
    Shall I let him in?
    Patiently pleading with my sad heart;
    O shall I let him in?
    Cold and proud is my heart with sin,
    Dark and cheerless is all within;
    Christ is bidding me turn unto him;
    O shall I let him in?

    2.
    Shall I send him the loving word?
    Shall I let him in?
    Meekly accepting my gracious Lord,
    O shall I let him in?
    He can infinite love impart,
    He can pardon this rebel heart;
    Shall I bid him forever depart,
    Or shall I let him in?

    3.
    Yes, I'll open this heart's proud decor,
    Yes, I'll let him in.
    Gladly I'll welcome him evermore;
    O, yes, I'll let him in.
    Blessed Saviour, abide with me,
    Cares and trials will lighter be;
    I am safe if I'm only with thee,
    O, blessed Lord, come in!
