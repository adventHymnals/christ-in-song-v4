    1.
    O heart bowed down with sorrow!
    O eyes that long for sight!
    There's gladness in believing;
    In Jesus there is light.

    Refrain:
    "Come unto me, all ye that labor, 
    and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
    Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;
    for I am meek and lowly in heart:
    and ye shall find rest unto your souls."

    2.
    Earth's fleeting gain and pleasure
    Can never satisfy;
    'Tis love our joy doth measure,
    For love can never die.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Divinest consolation
    Doth Christ the Healer give;
    Art thou in condemnation?
    Repent, believe and live.  [Refrain]

    4.
    His peace is like a river,
    His love is like a song;
    His yoke's a burden never;
    'Tis easy all day long.  [Refrain]
