    1.
    "Yet there is room!"  
    The Lamb's bright hall of song,
    With its fair glory, 
    beckons thee along;

    Refrain:
    Room, room, 
    yet there is room;
    Come, come, 
    come while there's room.

    2.
    Daylight declines, 
    The sun is sinking low;
    The shadows lengthen,
    light makes haste to go:  [Refrain]

    3.
    The bridal hall 
    is filling for the feast:
    Pass in!  pass in! 
    and be the Bridegroom's guest;  [Refrain]

    4.
    It fills, it fills, 
    that hall of jubilee!
    Make haste, make haste; 
    'tis not too full for thee:  [Refrain]

    5.
    Yet there is room!
    Still open stands the gate,
    The gate of love;
    it is not yet too late:  [Refrain]

    6.
    Pass in, pass in!  
    That banquet is for thee;
    That cup of everlasting 
    love is free:  [Refrain]

    7.
    All heaven is there,
    all joy!  Go in, go in;
    The angels beckon thee
    the prize to win:  [Refrain]

    8.
    Soon night will close that gate
    and seal thy doom:
    Then the sad cry,
    "No more for me, no room!'  [Refrain]
