    1.
    O golden day, so long desired,
    Born of a darksome night,
    The waiting earth at last is fired
    By Thy resplendent light.
    And hark!  the promised heav'nly chord
    Is heard from sea to sea:
    This song:  One Master, Christ the Lord
    And brethren all are we.

    2.
    The noises of the night shall cease,
    The storms no longer roar;
    The factious foes of love and peace
    Shall vex the soul no more.
    A thousand thousand voices sing
    The surging harmony:
    One Master, Christ, one Saviour-King;
    And brethren all are we.

    3.
    Sing on, ye heralds of the morn,
    Your grand endeavor strain,
    Till Christian hearts estranged and torn,
    Blend in the glad refrain;
    And all the church, with all its pow'rs,
    In loving loyalty,
    Shall sing:  One Master, Christ, is ours;
    And brethren all are we.

    4.
    O golden day!  the ages crown,
    Aglow with heavenly love,
    Rare day in prophecy's renown,
    On to thy zenith move,
    When earth and heav'n with one accord,
    In full-voiced unity.
    Shall sing:  One Master, Christ our Lord;
    And brethren all are we.
