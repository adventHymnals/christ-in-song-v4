[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iCSGIVXV5Kk%2DGhE_E9w%2DKLLSWA_TMQ9u/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There is sweet rest for feet now weary,
    In the rugged, upward way;
    There is a morn when midnight dreary
    Shall be lost in perfect day.

    2.
    For that blest morn our hearts are longing,
    When shall end earth's night of woe;
    When, thro' those pearly portals thronging,
    Mortal cares we leave below.

    3.
    Soon to that city, bright, eternal,
    Weary pilgrims all shall go;
    Soon we shall rest in pastures vernal,
    Where life's waters ceaseless flow.

    4.
    Father above, in mercy guide us
    To those mansions of the blest;
    Safe in the Rock of Ages hide us
    Till we gain our final rest.
