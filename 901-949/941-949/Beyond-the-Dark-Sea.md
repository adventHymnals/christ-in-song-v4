    1.
    I'm weary.  I'm fainting; my day's work is done;
    I'm watching and waiting for life's setting sun;
    The shadows are stretching afar o'er the lea:
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.
    The shadows are stretching afar o'er the lea,
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.

    2.
     The cold surging billows that break at my feet,
    Have lost all their terror, their music is sweet;
    My Saviour is stilling the tempest for me:
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.
    The shadows are stretching afar o'er the lea,
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.

    3.
    Come, loving Redeemer, and take to Thy breast
    The heart that is panting and sighing for rest;
    My Saviour, I'm waiting, I'm waiting:
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.
    The shadows are stretching afar o'er the lea,
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.

    4.
     I'll lay my life's burden, O Lord, at Thy feet, 
    Where angels are waiting with love's welcome sweet;
    The portals of glory are open for me:
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.
    The shadows are stretching afar o'er the lea,
    Then oh!  let me anchor beyond the dark sea.
