## 945.  When Thou Shalt Come
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h1LcMNr1AiDjMCmPgaGkRA8zp5AqZEbr/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    When thou, my righteous Judge, shalt come,
    To call thy ransom'd people home,
    Shall I among them stand?
    Shall such a worthless worm as I.
    Who sometimes am afraid to die
    Be found at thy right hand?

    2.
    I love to meet among them now,
    Before thy gracious throne to bow,
    Though weakest of them all;
    Nor can I bear the piercing thought,
    To have my worthless name left out,
    When thou for them shalt call.

    3.
    Let me among thy saints be found,
    When e'er th' Archangel's trump shall sound,
    To see thy smiling face;
    Then joyfully thy praise I'll sing,
    While heaven's resounding mansions ring
    With shouts of endless grace.
