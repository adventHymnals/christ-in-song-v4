    1.
    She/He hath passed death's chilling billow,
    And gone to rest;
    Jesus smoothed her/his dying pillow,
    O slumber blest!

    2.
    When the morn of glory, breaking,
    Shall light the tomb,
    Beautiful will be thy waking
    In fadeless bloom;

    3.
    Where no wintry winds are blowing,
    No burial train,
    Crown'd with life's celestial glowing,
    We'll meet again.
