    1.
    O how I long to see that day
    When the redeemed shall come
    To Zion, clad in white array
    Their blissful, happy home.

    Chorus:
    O bear me on, bear me on
    To Mount Zion;
    O bear me on to that city of love
    Where saints shall ever dwell.

    2.
    I'll hear the alleluias roll
    From the unnumbered throng,
    And with a heaven-enraptured soul
    I'll join redemption's song.  [Chorus]

    3.
    All hail!  the morn of glory's nigh
    The pilgrim longs to see
    That dries the tear from every eye
    Creation's jubilee.  [Chorus]
