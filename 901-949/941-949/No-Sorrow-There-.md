    1.
    There'll be no grief in heav'n;
    For life is one glad day,
    And tears are of those former things
    Which all have passed away.

    Refrain:
    There'll be no sorrow there,
    There'll be no sorrow there;
    In heav'n above, where all is love,
    There'll be no sorrow there.

    2.
    There'll be no sin in heav'n;
    Behold that blessed throng,
    All holy in their spotless robes,
    All holy in their song.  [Refrain]

    3.
    There'll be no death in heav'n;
    For they who gain that shore
    Have won their immortality,
    And they can die no more. [Refrain]
