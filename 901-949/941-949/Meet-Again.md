[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h1CB7vWX0aipccvATRx8pASOXSyYLWe9/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Meet again when time is o'er,
    Meet again to part no more;
    How it cheers the drooping heart.
    When from friend we're called to part!

    2.
    Meet again where endless joy
    We shall taste without alloy;
    Meet where songs shall ne'er grow old,
    Sweetly tuned to harps of gold.

    3.
    Meet again, how passing sweet,
    Friends long lost again to meet!
    Careworn souls, by temptest driv'n,
    O how sweet to meet in heav'n!
