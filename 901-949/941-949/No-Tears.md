[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gsXg0kfCr7TOHZJoYde9JKmTv2SEg082/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    No tears in yonder home;
    Sorrow can never come;
    Joy echoes thro' the dome;
    Love rules the endless years,
    No tears, No tears in yonder home.

    2.
    No pain in yonder home;
    Sickness has sealed her room;
    Health in immortal bloom
    Fills all the wide domain:
    No pain, No pain in yonder home.

    3.
    No death in yonder home;
    No parting hour of gloom;
    Death lies dead in the tomb,
    Whence rose the dust of Faith:
    No death, No death in yonder home.

    4.
    Clasping again our own,
    Knowing as we are known,
    Walking no more alone,
    Hail sinless Eden years!
    No tears, No tears in yonder home.
