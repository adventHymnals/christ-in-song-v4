    1.
    A few more years shall roll,
    A few more seasons come,
    And we shall meet the loved who now
    Are sleeping in the tomb:

    Chorus:
    Then, O my Lord, prepare
    My soul for that great day;
    O, wash me in thy precious blood,
    And take my sins away.

    2.
    A few more storms shall beat
    On this wild, rocky shore,
    And we shall be where tempests cease,
    And surges swell no more:  [Chorus]

    3.
    A few more struggles here,
    A few more partings sore,
    A few more toils, a few more tears,
    And we shall weep no more:  [Chorus]

    4.
    'Tis but a little while,
    And He shall come again,
    Who died that we might live, who lives
    That we may with him reign:  [Chorus]
