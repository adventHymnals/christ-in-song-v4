    1.
    Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning!
    Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain!
    Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mourning:
    Zion, in triumph, begins her mild reign.

    2.
    Lo, in the desert, rich flowers are springing;
    Streams ever copious are gliding along;
    Loud, from the mountaintops, echoes are ringing;
    Wastes rise in verdure, and mingle in song.

    3.
    See, the dead risen from land and from ocean;
    Praise to Jehovah, ascending on high;
    Fall'n are the engines of war and commotion;
    Shouts of salvation are rending the sky.
