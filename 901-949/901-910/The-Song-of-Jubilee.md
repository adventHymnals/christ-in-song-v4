    1.
    Hark!  the song of Jubilee;
    Loud as mighty thunders roar,
    Or the fulness of the sea
    When it breaks upon the shore;
    Hallelujah!  'tis the Lord!
    Lo, he comes on earth to reign;
    Hallelujah!  let the word
    Echo round the earth and main.

    2.
    Hallelujah!  hark!  the sound
    Rises joyful to the skies;
    From above, beneath, around,
    Wake creation's harmonies:
    See Jehovah's banner furl'd,
    Sheath'd his sword:  he speaks, 'tis done;
    Hallelujah!  let the word
    Echo around the earth and main.

    3.
    He shall reign from pole to pole
    With supreme, unbounded sway;
    He shall reign, when like a scroll
    Yonder heav'ns have pass'd away:
    Then beneath his iron rod,
    Man's last enemy shall fall;
    Hallelujah!  to our God,
    Lo, he comes to conquer all.
