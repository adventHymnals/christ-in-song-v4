    1.
    We are joyously voyaging over the main,
    Bound for the evergreen shore,
    Whose inhabitants never of sickness complain,
    And never see death any more.

    Chorus:
    Then let the hurricane roar,
    It will the sooner be o'er;
    We will weather the blast, and we'll land at last,
    Safe on the evergreen shore.

    2.
    We have nothing to fear from the wind and the wave,
    Under our Saviour's command;
    And our hearts in the midst of the dangers are brave,
    For Jesus will bring us to land.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Both the wind and the wave our Commander controls,
    Nothing can baffle his skill;
    And his voice when the thundering hurricane rolls,
    Can make the loud tempest be still.  [Chorus]

    4.
    In the thick murky night, when the stars and the moon,
    Send not a glimmering ray,
    Then the light of his countenance, brighter than noon,
    Will drive all our terror away.  [Chorus]

    5.
    Let the high-heaving billows and mountainous wave,
    Fearfully overhead break;
    There is One by our side that can comfort and save,
    There is One who will never forsake.  [Chorus]
