    1.
    Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness;
    Awake, for thy foes shall oppress thee no more.
    Bright, o'er thy hills, dawns the day star of gladness,
    Arise, for the night of thy sorrow is o'er.

    Chorus:
    Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness;
    Awake, for thy foes shall oppress thee no more.

    2.
     Strong were thy foes; but the arm that subdued them,
    And scattered their legions, was mightier far;
    They fled like the chaff from the scourge that pursued them;
    In vain were their steeds and their chariots of war.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Daughter of Zion, the power that hath saved thee,
    Extolled with the harp and the timbrel shall be;
    Shout:  for the foe is destroyed that enslaved thee;
    Th' oppressor is vanquished, and Zion is free.  [Chorus]
