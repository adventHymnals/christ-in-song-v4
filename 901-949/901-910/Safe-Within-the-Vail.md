    1.
    "Land ahead!"  its fruits are waving
    O'er the hills of fadeless green,
    And the living waters laving
    Shores where heav'nly forms are seen.

    Chorus:
    Rock and storms I'll fear no more,
    When on that eternal shore;
    I am safe within the vail!

    2.
    Onward bark!  the cape I'm rounding;
    See the blessed wave their hands!
    Hear the harps of God resounding
    From the bright immortal band!  [Chorus]

    3.
    Now we're safe from all temptation,
    All the storms of life are past
    Praise the Rock of our salvation,
    We are safe at home at last!  [Chorus]
