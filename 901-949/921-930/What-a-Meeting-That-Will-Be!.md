    1.
    When Jesus calls His jewels
    From ev'ry land and sea,
    And takes them home to glory,
    What a meeting that will be!

    Refrain:
    We'll meet them in glory,
    Meet them in glory,
    Meet them in glory;
    What a meeting that will be!

    2.
    We'll meet the friends departed,
    The loved ones called away;
    Not one will be forgotten
    In the glad reunion day.  [Refrain]

    3.
    We'll meet the kings and prophets
    Of ages long ago,
    And all the faithful martyrs
    Who bled for truth below.  [Refrain]

    4.
    We'll meet in all His beauty
    The One whom we adore,
    Who died that we, believing,
    May live forevermore.  [Refrain]
