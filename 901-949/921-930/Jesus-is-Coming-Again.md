    1.
    Lift up the trumpet, and loud let it ring;
    Jesus is coming again!
    Cheer up, ye pilgrims, be joyful and sing;
    Jesus is coming again!

    Chorus:
    Coming again, coming again,
    Jesus is coming again!

    2.
    Echo it, hilltops, proclaim it, ye plains;
    Jesus is coming again!
    Coming in glory, the Lamb that was slain;
    Jesus is coming again!  [Chorus]

    3.
    Sound it, old ocean, in each mighty wave;
    Jesus is coming again!
    Break on the sands of the shores that ye lave;
    Jesus is coming again!  [Chorus]

    4.
    Heavings of earth, tell the vast, wond'ring throng;
    Jesus is coming again!
    Tempests and whirlwinds, the anthem prolong;
    Jesus is coming again!  [Chorus]

    5.
    Nations are angry, by this do we know;
    Jesus is coming again!
    Knowledge increases, men run to and fro;
    Jesus is coming again!  [Chorus]
