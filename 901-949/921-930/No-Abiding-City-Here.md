[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1glJw1O0N2vS4eq8ZnrwVUlM7nbhW2daB/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    We've no abiding city here;
    Sad truth, were this to be our home;
    But let this thought our spirits cheer,
    We seek a city yet to come,
    We seek a city yet to come.

    2.
    We've no abiding city here,
    We seek a city out of sight;
    Zion its name, the Lord is there,
    It shines with ever lasting light,
    It shines with ever lasting light.

    3.
    O sweet abode of peace and love,
    Where pilgrims freed from toil, are blest!
    Had I the pinions of a dove,
    I'd fly to thee, and be at rest,
    I'd fly to thee, and be at rest.

    4.
    But hush, my soul!  nor dare repine;
    The time my God appoints is best;
    While here, to do his will be mine,
    And his to fix my time of rest,
    And his to fix my time of rest.
