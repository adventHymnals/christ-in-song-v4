    1.
    Christ is coming!  let creation
    Bid her groans and travails cease;
    Let the glorious proclamation
    Hope restore and faith increase;
    Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!
    Come, thou blessed Prince of Peace!

    2.
    Earth can now but tell the story
    Of thy bitter cross and pain;
    She shall soon behold thy glory,
    When thou comest back to reign;
    Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!
    Let each heart repeat the strain.

    3.
    Long thy exiles have been pining,
    Far from rest, and home, and thee;
    But, in heav'nly vesture shining,
    Soon they shall thy glory see;
    Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!
    Hast the joyous jubilee.

    4.
    With that "blessed hope" before us,
    Let no harp remain unstrung;
    Let the mighty advent chorus
    Onward roll, from tongue to tongue;
    Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!
    Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
