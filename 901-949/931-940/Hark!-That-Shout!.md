[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hahF3m065JOPfpdWK5hByKF1hUY6%2DKwE/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Hark!  that shout of rapture high,
    Bursting forth from yonder cloud;
    Jesus comes, thro' the sky,
    Angels tell their joy aloud,
    Angels tell their joy aloud.

    2.
    Hark!  the trumpet's awful voice
    Sounds abroad o'er sea and land;
    Let his people now rejoice;
    Their redemption is at hand,
    Their redemption is at hand.

    3.
    See, the Lord appears in view;
    Heav'n and earth before him fly;
    Rise, ye saints, he comes for you;
    Rise, to meet him in the sky,
    Rise, to meet him in the sky.

    4.
    Go and dwell with him above,
    Where no foe can e'er molest;
    Happy in the Saviour's love,
    Ever blessing, ever blest,
    Ever blessing, ever blest.
