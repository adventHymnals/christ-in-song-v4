    1.
    Rest for the toiling hand,
    Rest for the anxious brow,
    Rest for the weary, way-worn feet,
    Rest from all labor now.

    2.
    Soon shall the trump of God
    Give out the welcome sound
    That shakes thy silent chamber walls,
    And breaks the turf-sealed ground.

    3.
    'Twas sown in weakness here,
    'Twill then be raised in pow'r;
    That which was sown as earthly seed,
    Shall rise a heav'nly flow'r!
