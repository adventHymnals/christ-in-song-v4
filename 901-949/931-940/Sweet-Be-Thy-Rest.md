    1.
    Sweet be thy rest,
    And peaceful thy sleeping;
    God's way is best,
    Thou art in his keeping.
    O blessed sleep,
    Where ills ne'er molest thee!
    Why should we weep?
    For heaven hath blessed thee:
    Sweet be thy rest.

    2.
    Thy work is done,
    Thy sowing and reaping;
    Thy crown is won,
    And hush'd is thy weeping.
    From tears and woes,
    From earth's midnight dreary,
    Thine is repose
    Where none ever weary:
    Sweet be thy rest.

    3.
    Sweet be thy rest;
    No more we may greet thee
    Till with the blest
    In heaven we meet thee.
    O union sweet,
    That death can not sever!
    There we shall meet,
    Where sad tears fall never:
    Sweet be thy rest.
