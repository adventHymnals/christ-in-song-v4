    1.
    Soon shall we meet again,
    Meet ne'er to sever,
    Soon shall peace wreathe her chain
    Round us forever;
    Our hearts can ne'er repose,
    Safe from each blast that blows.
    In this dark vale of woes;
    Never, no, never!

    2.
    Soon shall love freely flow
    Pure as life's river;
    Soon shall sweet friendship glow,
    Changeless forever.
    Where joys celestial thrill,
    There bliss each heart shall fill.
    And fears of parting chill
    Never, no, never!

    3.
    Then to that world of light
    Take us, dear Saviour;
    May we all there unite,
    Blessed forever;
    Where kindred spirits dwell,
    There may our music swell,
    And time our joys dispell
    Never, no, never!
