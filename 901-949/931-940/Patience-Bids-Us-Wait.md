    1.
    The glories of that heav'nly land
    I've ofttimes felt before;
    But what I feel is just a taste,
    And makes me long for more,
    And makes me long for more.

    2.
    Had I the pinious of a dove,
    I'd fly and be at rest;
    Then would I go to Christ, my love,
    And dwell among the blest,
    And dwell among the blest.

    3.
    But Patience bids us wait awhile!
    The crown's for them that fight;
    The prize for those that win the race
    By faith, and not by sight,
    By faith, and not by sight.
