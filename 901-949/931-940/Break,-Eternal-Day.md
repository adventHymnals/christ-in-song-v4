    1.
    Break, break, eternal day,
    Bid darkness flee away;
    Pour on our sight
    Light from the world of joy,
    Bliss pure without alloy;
    Then ne'er shall gloom annoy;
    All shall be bright.

    2.
    Rise, rise, thou glorious Sun,
    Hasten thy race to run;
    At God's command 
    Extend thy healing wings;
    Open joy's long-sealed springs;
    Reign, O thou King of kings,
    In this dark land.

    3.
    Come, come, thou conqu'ring One,
    Reign upon thy throne,
    In glory bright;
    Then shall the ransomed raise,
    Unceasing songs of praise,
    Thro'out eternal days,
    In realms of light.
