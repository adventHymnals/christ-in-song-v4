    1.
    My life, my love, I give to thee,
    Thou Lamb of God, who died for me;
    O, may I ever faithful be,
    My Saviour and my God!

    Chorus:
    I'll live for him who died for me;
    How happy then my life shall be!
    I'll live for him who died for me,
    My Saviour and my God!

    2.
    I now believe thou dost receive,
    For thou hast died that I might live,
    And now henceforth I'll trust in thee,
    My Saviour and my God!  [Chorus]

    3.
    O thou who died on Calvary,
    To save my soul and make me free,
    I consecrate my life to thee,
    My Saviour and my God!  [Chorus]
