    1.
    Welcome, delightful morning,
    Thou day of sacred rest;
    I hail thy kind return;
    Lord, make these moments blest.
    From the low train of mortal toys
    I soar to reach immortal joys,
    I sour to reach immortal joys.

    2.
    Now may the King descend,
    And fill his throne of grace;
    Thy scepter, Lord, extend,
    While saints address thy face;
    Let sinners feel thy quick'ning word,
    And learn to know and fear the Lord.

    3.
    Descend, celestial Dove,
    With all thy quick'ning pow'rs;
    Disclose a Saviour's love,
    And bless these sacred hours;
    Then shall my soul new life obtain,
    Nor Sabbath-days be passed in vain.
