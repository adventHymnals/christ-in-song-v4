## 390.  That Song of Old
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WMJef_wPzWDGt9r_UmeRBLureDJWAl%2Dt/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    It came upon the midnight clear,
    That glorious song of old,
    From angels bending near the earth
    To touch their harps of gold;
    "Peace on the earth, good will to men,
    From heav'n's all-gracious King."
    The world in solemn stillness lay,
    To hear the angels sing.

    2.
    Still thro' the open skies they come,
    With peaceful wing unfurled;
    And still their heav'nly music floats
    O'er all the weary world;
    Above its sad and lowly plains
    They bend on hov'ring wing,
    And ever o'er its Babel sounds
    The blessed angels sing.

    3.
    But with the woes of sin and strife
    The world has suffered long;
    Beneath the angel-strain have rolled
    Two thousand years of wrong;
    And man, at war with man, hears not
    The love-song which they bring;
    O cease, ye mortals, cease your strife,
    And hear the angels sing!
