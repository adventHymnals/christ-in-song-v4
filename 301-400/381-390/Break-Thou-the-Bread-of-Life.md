[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X0kuNYtH%2De4021Te8nPkO5ImjXrz80po/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Break Thou the bread of life,
    Dear Lord, to me,
    As Thou didst break the loaves
    Beside the sea;
    Beyond the sacred page
    I seek Thee, Lord;
    My spirit pants for Thee,
    O living Word!

    2.
    Bless Thou the truth, revealed
    This day to me,
    As Thou didst bless the bread
    By Galilee;
    Then shall all bondage cease,
    All fetters fall;
    And I shall find in Thee
    My All-in-All!

    3.
    Spirit and Life are they,
    Words Thou dost speak;
    I hasten to obey,
    But I am weak;
    Thou art my only help,
    Thou art my life;
    Heeding Thy holy word
    I win the strife.
