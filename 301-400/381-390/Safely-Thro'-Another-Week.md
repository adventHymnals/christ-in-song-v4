    1.
    Safely thro' another week
    God has brought us on our way;
    Let us now a blessing seek,
    Waiting in his courts today,
    Day of all the week the best,
    Emblem of eternal rest,
    Day of all the week the best,
    Emblem of eternal rest.

    2.
    While we seek supplies of grace
    Thro' the dear Redeemer's name,
    Show thy reconciling face,
    Take away our sin and shame;
    From our worldly cares set free
    May we rest this day in thee,
    From our worldly cares set free
    May we rest this day in thee.

    3.
    Here we come thy name to praise,
    May we feel thy presence near,
    May thy glory meet our eyes
    While we in thy courts appear;
    Here afford us, Lord, a taste
    Of our everlasting feast,
    Here afford us, Lord, a taste
    Of our everlasting feast.

    4.
    May the gospel's joyful sound
    Conquer sinners, comfort saints;
    Make the fruits of grace abound,
    Bring relief to all complaints;
    Thus may all our Sabbaths be
    Till we rise to reign with thee,
    Thus may all our Sabbaths be
    Till we rise to reign with thee.
