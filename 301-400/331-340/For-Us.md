    1.
    O Love!  how deep, how broad, how high!
    It fills the heart with ecstacy,
    That God, the Son of God, should take
    Our mortal form for mortals' sake.

    2.
    For us He was baptized, and bore 
    His holy fast, and hungered sore;
    For us temptations sharp He knew;
    For us the tempter overthrew.

    3.
    For us He prayed, for us He taught,
    For us His daily works He wrought,
    By words, and signs, and actions thus
    Still seeking not Himself but us.

    4.
    For us to wicked men betrayed,
    Scourged, mocked, purple robe arrayed,
    He bore the shameful cross and death;
    For us at length gave up His breath.

    5.
    For us He rose from death again,
    For us He went on high to reign,
    For us He sent His Spirit here
    To guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.

    6.
    To Him whose boundless love has won
    Salvation for us through His Son,
    To God the Father, glory be,
    Both now and through eternity.
