    1.
    Day is dying in the west;
    Heav'n is touching earth with rest:
    Wait and worship while the night
    Sets her evening lamps alight
    Thro' all the sky.

    Chorus:
    Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!
    Heav'n and earth are full of Thee!
    Heav'n and earth are praising Thee,
    O Lord most high.

    2.
    Lord of Life, beneath the dome
    Of the universe, thy home,
    Gather us, who seek Thy face,
    To the fold of Thy embrace,
    For Thou art nigh.  [Chorus]

    3.
    While the deep'ning shadows fall,
    Heart of Love, enfold us all;
    Thro' the glory and the grace
    Of the stars that veil thy face,
    Our hearts ascend.  [Chorus]

    4.
    When forever from our sight,
    Pass the stars, the day, the night,
    Lord of angels, on our eyes
    Let eternal morning rise,
    And shadows end.  [Chorus]
