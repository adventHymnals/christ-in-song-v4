    1.
    My life flows on in endless song;
    Amid earth's lamentation,
    I hear the sweet, tho' far-off hymn
    That hails a new creation;
    Thro' all the tumult and the strife
    I hear the music ringing;
    It finds an echo in my soul,
    How can I keep from singing?

    2.
    What tho' my joys and comforts die,
    The Lord my Helper liveth!
    What tho' the darkness gather round;
    Songs in the night he giveth!
    No storm can shake my inmost calm
    While to that refuge clinging;
    Since God is Lord of heav'n and earth,
    How can I keep from singing?

    3.
    I lift mine eyes; the cloud grows thin;
    I see the blue above it;
    And day by day this pathway smooths
    Since first I learned to love it.
    The peace of God makes fresh my heart,
    A fountain ever springing;
    All things are mine, since I am His
    How can I keep from singing?
