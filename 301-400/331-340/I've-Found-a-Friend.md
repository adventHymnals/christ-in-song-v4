    1.
    I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
    He loved me ere I knew Him:
    He drew me with the cords of love,
    And thus He bound me to Him.
    And 'round my heart still closely twine
    These ties which naught can sever,
    For I am His, and He is mine,
    Forever and forever.

    2.
    I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
    He bled, He died to save me;
    And not alone the gift of life,
    But His own self He gave me.
    Naught that I have my own I call,
    I hold it for the Giver;
    My heart, my strength, my life, my all,
    Are His, and His forever.

    3.
    I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
    All pow'r to Him is given;
    To guard me on my upward course,
    And bring me safe to heaven.
    Th' eternal glories gleam afar,
    To nerve my faint endeavor;
    So now to watch, to work, to war,
    And then to rest forever.

    4.
    I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
    So kind, and true, and tender,
    So wise a Counselor and Guide,
    So mighty a Defender.
    From Him, who loveth me so well,
    What pow'r my soul can sever?
    Shall life or death, or earth or hell?
    No; I am His forever.
