[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QiH%2DGVzi0I1w4fwB6CGeHrO4zEUCAV3Q/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God's free mercy streameth
    Over all the world,
    And His banner gleameth,
    By His church unfurled;
    Broad and deep and glorious,
    As the heav'n above,
    Shines in might victorious
    His eternal love.

    2.
    Summer suns are glowing
    Over land and sea;
    Happy light is flowing,
    Bountiful and free;
    Evrything rejoices 
    In the mellow rays;
    Earth's ten thousand voices
    Swell the psalm of praise.

    3.
    Lord, upon our blindness,
    Thy pure radiance pour;
    For Thy loving kindness
    We would love Thee more;
    And when clouds are drifting
    Dark across the sky,
    Then, the vail uplifting,
    Father, be Thou nigh.

    4.
    We will never doubt Thee,
    Tho' Thou vail Thy light;
    Life is dark without Thee,
    Death with Thee is bright;
    Light of light, shine o'er us
    On our pilgrim way,
    Go Thou still before us
    To the endless day.
