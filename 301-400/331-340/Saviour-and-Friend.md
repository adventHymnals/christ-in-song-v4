    1.
    Rest of the weary, 
    Joy of the sad,
    Hope of the dreary, 
    Light of the glad;
    Home of the stranger, 
    Strength to the end,
    Refuge from danger, 
    Saviour and Friend;
    Refuge from danger, 
    Saviour and Friend,
    Saviour and Friend.

    2.
    Pillow where lying, 
    Love rests her head;
    Peace of the dying, 
    Life of the dead;
    Path of the lowly,
    Prize at the end,
    Breath of the holy,
    Saviour and Friend;
    Breath of the holy, 
    Saviour and Friend,
    Saviour and Friend.

    3.
    When my feet stumble,
    To Thee I cry;
    Crown of the humble, 
    Cross of the high;
    When my steps wander,
    Over me bend,
    Truer and fonder,
    Saviour and Friend;
    True and fonder,
    Saviour and Friend,
    Saviour and Friend.

    4.
    Ever confessing Thee,
    I will raise
    Unto Thee blessing,
    Glory, and praise;
    All my endeavor,
    World without end,
    Thine to be ever,
    Saviour and Friend;
    Thine to be ever,
    Saviour and Friend,
    Saviour and Friend.
