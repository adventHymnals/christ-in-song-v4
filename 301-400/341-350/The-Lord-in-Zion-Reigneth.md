    1.
    The Lord in Zion reigneth!  
    Let all the earth rejoice,
    And come before his throne of grace
    With tuneful heart and voice;
    The Lord in Zion reigneth,
    And there his praise shall ring,
    To him shall princes bend the knee,
    And kings their glory bring.

    2.
    The Lord in Zion reigneth,
    And who so great as he?
    The depths of earth are in his hands,
    He rules the mighty sea;
    O crown his name with honor,
    And let his standard wave,
    Till distant isles beyond the deep
    Shall own his pow'r to save.

    3.
    The Lord in Zion reigneth,
    These hours to him belong,
    O enter now his temple gates,
    And fill his courts with song;
    Beneath his royal banner,
    Let ev'ry creature fall,
    Exalt the King of heav'n and earth,
    "And crown him Lord of all!"
