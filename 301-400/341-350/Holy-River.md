    1.
    Fresh from the throne of glory,
    Bright in its crystal gleam,
    Bursts out the living Fountain,
    Swells on the living Stream.

    Refrain:
    Holy River, I would ever
    Draw my life from thee;
    Mighty River, I will never
    Cease to sing of thee.

    2.
    Stream full of life and gladness,
    Spring of all health and peace,
    No harps by thee hang silent,
    Nor happy voices cease.  [Refrain]

    3.
    River of God, I greet thee,
    Now not afar, but near;
    My soul to thy still waters
    Hastes in its thirstings here.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Jesus, the healing Fountain,
    Fresh from the throne above,
    Thou art the living water,
    Thou art the stream of love.  [Refrain]
