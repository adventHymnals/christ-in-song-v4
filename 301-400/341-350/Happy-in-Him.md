    1.
    How tedious and tasteless the hours
    When Jesus no longer I see!
    Sweet prospects, sweet birds, and sweet flow'rs,
    Have all lost their sweetness to me;
    The midsummer sun shines but dim,
    The fields strive in vain to look gay;
    But when I am happy in him,
    December's as pleasant as May.

    2.
    His name yields the richest perfume,
    And sweeter than music his voice;
    His presence disperses my gloom,
    And makes all within me rejoice:
    I should, were he always thus nigh,
    Have nothing to wish or to fear;
    No mortal so happy as I,
    My summer would last all the year.

    3.
    My Lord, if indeed I am thine,
    If thou art my Sun and my Song,
    Say, why do I languish and pine?
    And why are my winters so long?
    O drive these dark clouds from my sky,
    Thy soul-cheering presence restore;
    Or take me to thee up on high,
    Where winter and clouds are no more.
