    1.
    Jesus, I my cross have taken,
    All to leave and follow thee;
    All things else I have forsaken,
    Thou henceforth my all shalt be;
    Perish ev'ry fond ambition,
    All I've sought or hoped or known;
    Yet how much is my condition,
    God and heav'n are still my own.

    2.
    Let the world despise and leave me,
    They have left my Saviour, too;
    Human hearts and looks deceive me;
    Thou art faithful, thou art true;
    And, while thou dost smile upon me,
    God of wisdom, love and might,
    Foes may hate, and friends may shun me;
    Show thy face, and all is bright.

    3.
    Hast'ning on from grace to glory,
    Arm'd by faith and wing'd by pray'r;
    Heav'n's eternal day's before me,
    God's own hand is guiding there.
    Soon shall close my earthly mission,
    Swift shall pass these pilgrim days,
    Hope shall change to glad fruition,
    Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.
