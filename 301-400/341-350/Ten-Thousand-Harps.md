    1.
    Hark!  ten thousand harps and voices
    Sound the note of praise above;
    Jesus reigns, and heav'n rejoices;
    Jesus reigns, the God of love;
    See, he sits on yonder throne;
    Jesus rules the world alone.
    Hallelujah!  hallelujah!  hallelujah! amen.

    2.
    King of glory, reign forever,
    Thine an everlasting crown;
    Nothing from thy love shall sever
    Those whom thou dost seal thine own;
    Happy objects of thy grace,
    Destined to behold thy face.
    Hallelujah!  hallelujah!  hallelujah!  amen.

    3.
    Saviour, hasten thine appearing;
    Bring, O bring, the glorious day
    When the awful summons bearing, 
    Heav'n and earth shall pass away!
    Then, with golden harps, we'll sing,
    "Glory, glory to our King.
    Hallelujah!  hallelujah!  hallelujah!  amen.
