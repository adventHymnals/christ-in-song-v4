[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TbjkM9ryf9Boa89HxqACOgIKa8mbNtZb/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Let the whole Creation cry
    Glory to the Lord on high!
    Heav'n and earth, awake and sing
    "God is good, and therefore King."

    2.
    Praise Him, all ye hosts above,
    Praise Him, Lord of life and love!
    Sun and moon, uplift your voice,
    Night and stars, in God rejoice.

    3.
    Rivers roll His praise along,
    Ocean chant His anthem song!
    Sunshine, darkness, cloud and storm,
    Rain and snow His praise perform.

    4.
    Kings of knowledge and of law,
    To the glorious circle draw;
    All who work and all who wait,
    Sing, "The Lord is good and great."
