    1.
    Have I need of aught, O Saviour!
    Aught on earth but thee?
    Have I any in the heavens,
    Any one but thee?

    Chorus:
    Only thee, only thee,
    O the wondrous love shown me!
    Only thee, only thee,
    None on earth but thee.

    2.
    Tho' I have of friends so many,
    Love, and gold, and health;
    If I have not thee, my Saviour,
    Hold I any wealth?  [Chorus]

    3.
    Is there heart so kind and patient
    With my failings all?
    Or a voice so true and ready,
    Answering my call?  [Chorus]

    4.
    Not for worlds would I exchange it,
    This sweet faith in thee!
    Earthly treasures cannot equal
    All thou art to me.  [Chorus]
