    1.
    Fade, fade each earthly joy,
    Jesus is mine!
    Break ev'ry tender tie,
    Jesus is mine!
    Dark is the wilderness,
    Earth has no resting place,
    Jesus alone can bless,
    Jesus is mine!

    2.
    Tempt not my soul away,
    Jesus is mine! 
    Here would I ever stay,
    Jesus is mine!
    Perishing things of clay,
    Born but for one brief day,
    Pass from my heart away,
    Jesus is mine!

    3.
    Farewell, ye dreams of night,
    Jesus is mine!
    Lost in this dawning light,
    Jesus is mine!
    All that my soul has tried,
    Left but a dismal void,
    Jesus has satisfied,
    Jesus is mine!

    4.
    Farewell, mortality,
    Jesus is mine!
    Welcome eternity,
    Jesus is mine!
    Welcome, O lov'd and blest,
    Welcome, sweet scenes of rest,
    Welcome my Saviour's breast,
    Jesus is mine!
