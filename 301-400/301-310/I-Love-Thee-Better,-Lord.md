    1.
    I know I love thee better, Lord,
    Than any earthly joy;
    For thou hast given me the peace
    Which nothing can destroy.

    Chorus:
    The half has never yet been told,
    Of love so full and free;
    The half has never yet been told,
    The blood it cleanseth me.

    2.
    I know that thou art nearer still
    Than any earthly throng;
    And sweeter is the tho't of thee
    Than any lovely song.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Thou hast put gladness in my heart;
    Then may I well be glad;
    Without the secret of thy love 
    I could not but be sad.  [Chorus]

    4.
    O Saviour, precious Saviour, mine!
    What will thy presence be,
    If such a life of joy can crown
    Our walk on earth with thee?  [Chorus]
