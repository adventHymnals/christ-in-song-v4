    1.
    Hover o'er me, Holy Spirit,
    Bathe my trembling heart and brow;
    Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,
    Come, O come and fill me now.
    Fill me now, fill me now,
    Jesus, come and fill me now.
    Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,
    Come, O come and fill me now.

    2.
    Thou canst fill me, gracious Spirit,
    Tho' I cannot tell thee how;
    But I need thee, greatly need thee;
    Come, O come and fill me now.
    Fill me now, fill me now,
    Jesus, come and fill me now.
    Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,
    Come, O come and fill me now.

    3.
    I am weakness, full of weakness;
    At thy sacred feet I bow;
    Blest, divine, eternal Spirit,
    Fill with love, and fill me now.
    Fill me now, fill me now,
    Jesus, come and fill me now.
    Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,
    Come, O come and fill me now.

    4.
    Cleanse and comfort, bless and save me;
    Bathe, O, bathe my heart and brow;
    Thou art conforting and saving,
    Thou art sweetly filling now.
    Fill me now, fill me now,
    Jesus, come and fill me now.
    Fill me with thy hallow'd presence,
    Come, O come and fill me now.
