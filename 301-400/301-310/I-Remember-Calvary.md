    1.
    Where He may lead me I will go,
    For I have learned to trust Him so,
    And I remember 'twas for me,
    That He was slain on Calvary.

    Chorus:
    Jesus shall lead me night and day,
    Jesus shall lead me all the way,
    He is the truest Friend to me,
    For I remember Calvary.

    2.
    O I delight in His command,
    Love to be led by His dear hand,
    His divine will is sweet to me,
    Hallowed by blood-stained Calvary.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Onward I go, nor doubt, nor fear,
    Happy with Christ, my Saviour near,
    Trusting that I some day shall see
    Jesus my Friend, of Calvary.  [Chorus]
