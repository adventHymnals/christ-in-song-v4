    1.
    God loved the world of sinners lost
    And ruined by the fall;
    Salvation full, at highest cost,
    He offers free to all.

    Chorus:
    Oh, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love!
    The love of God to me;
    It bro't my Saviour from above,
    To die on Calvary.

    2.
    E'en now by faith I claim Him mine,
    The risen Son of God;
    Redemption by His death I find,
    And cleansing thro' the blood.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Love brings the glorious fullness in,
    And to His saints makes known,
    The blessed rest from inbred sin,
    Thro' faith in Christ alone.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Believing souls, rejoicing go;
    There shall to you be giv'n
    A glorious foretaste, here below,
    Of endless life in heav'n.  [Chorus]

    5.
    Of vict'ry now o'er Satan's pow'r
    Let all the ransom'd sing,
    And triumph in the dying hour
    Thro' Christ the Lord, our King.  [Chorus]
