[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RPqKyRuj_PTRT75YYWkLiU8XGF%2DayOr3/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Grant thy blessing, now, O Lord,
    While we look into thy word:
    To our hearts thy truth reveal;
    Fill us with a holy zeal;
    As we learn thy righteous way,
    Give us power to obey.

    2.
    Sanctify us, Lord, we pray,
    By the lessons of this day:
    May our souls by thee be fed,
    And to living fountains led;
    In a world of care and sin,
    Keep us ever pure within.
