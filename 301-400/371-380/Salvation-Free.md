    1.
    Come, ye that love the Lord,
    And let your joy be known;
    Join in a song with sweet accord,
    And thus surround the throne.

    Chorur:
    I'm glad salvation's free,
    I'm glad salvation's free;
    Salvation's free for you and me;
    I'm glad salvation's free.

    2.
    Let those refuse to sing
    Who never knew our God;
    But servants of the heav'nly King
    May speak their joys abroad.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Then let our songs a bound,
    And ev'ry tear be dry;
    We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground
    To fairer worlds on high.  [Chorus]
