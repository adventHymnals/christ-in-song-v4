    1.
    Salvation!  O the joyful sound,
    'Tis pleasure to our ears,
    A sov'reign balm for ev'ry wound,
    A cordial for our fears.

    2.
    Buried in sorrow and in sin,
    At hell's dark door we lay;
    But we arise, by grace divine,
    To see a heav'nly day.

    3.
    Salvation!  let the echo fly
    The spacious earth around,
    While all the armies of the sky
    Unite to swell the sound.
