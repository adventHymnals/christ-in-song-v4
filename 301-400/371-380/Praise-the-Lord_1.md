    1.
    Praise ye the Lord; for it is good
    Praise to our God to sing;
    For it is pleasant, and to praise 
    It is a comely thing.  

    Chorus:
    Praise the Lord, it is good
    Praise to our God to sing:
    For it is pleasant, and to praise
    It is a comely thing.

    2.
    Those that are broken in their heart,
    And troubled in their minds,
    He healeth, and their painful wounds
    He tenderly upbinds.  [Chorus]

    3.
    He counts the number of the stars;
    He names them ev'ry one:
    Our Lord is great, and of great pow'r,
    His wisdom search can none.  [Chorus]
