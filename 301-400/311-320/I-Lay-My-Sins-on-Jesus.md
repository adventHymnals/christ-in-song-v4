    1.
    I lay my sins on Jesus,
    The spotless Lamb of God;
    He bears them all, and frees us
    From the accursed load.
    I bring my guilt to Jesus,
    To watch the crimson stains
    White in His blood most precious,
    Till not one spot remains.

    2.
    I lay my wants on Jesus;
    All fullness dwells in Him;
    He heals all my diseases,
    He doth my soul redeem:
    I lay my griefs on Jesus,
    My burdens and my cares,
    He from them all releases,
    He all my sorrow shares.

    3.
    I long to be like Jesus,
    Meek, loving, lowly, mild;
    I long to be like Jesus,
    The Father's holy child:
    I long to be with Jesus
    Amid the heav'nly throng,
    To sing with them His praises,
    To learn the angel's song.
