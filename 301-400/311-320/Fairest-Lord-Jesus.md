    1.
    Fairest Lord Jesus,
    Ruler of all nature,
    O Thou of God and man the Son!
    Thee will I cherish,
    Thee will I honor,
    Thou art my glory, joy, and crown.

    2.
    Fair are the meadows,
    Fairer still the woodlands,
    Robed in the blooming garb of spring;
    Jesus is fairer,
    Jesus is purer,
    Who makes the woeful heart to sing.

    3.
    Fair is the sunshine,
    Fairer still the moonlight,
    And all the twinkling, starry host;
    Jesus shines brighter,
    Jesus shines purer
    Than all the angels heav'n can boast.  Amen.
