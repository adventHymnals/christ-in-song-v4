    1.
    Take my life, and let it be
    Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
    Take my hands and let them move
    At the impulse of Thy love.

    Chorus:
    Wash me in the Saviour's precious blood
    Cleanse me in its purifying flood
    Lord, I give to Thee, my life and all, to be,
    Thine, henceforth eternally.

    2.
    Take my feet, and let them be
    Swift and beautiful for Thee;
    Take my voice and let me sing
    Always, only, for my King.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Take my lips and let them be
    Filled with messages for Thee;
    Take my silver and my gold,
    Not a mite would I withhold.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Take my moments and my days,
    Let them flow in endless praise;
    Take my intellect, and use,
    Ev'ry pow'r as thou shalt choose.  [Chorus]

    5.
    Take my will, and make it Thine;
    It shall be no longer mine!
    Take my heart, it is thine own,
    It shall be Thy royal throne.  [Chorus]

    6.
    Take my love, my Lord, I pour
    At Thy feet its treasure store;
    Take myself, and I will be
    Ever, only, all for Thee.  [Chorus]
