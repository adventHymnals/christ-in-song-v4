[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WACZGeQuYYXZvN8ZsnboZxpypDz8LY6y/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,
    When Thou camest to earth for me;
    But in Bethlehem's home there was found no room
    For Thy holy nativity.

    Refrain:
    Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
    There is room in my heart for Thee!

    2.
    Heaven's arches rang when the angels sang,
    Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
    But in lowly birth didst Thou come to earth
    And in great humility.

    Refrain:  Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
    There is room in my heart for Thee!

    3.
    Thou camest, O Lord, with the living word,
    That should set Thy people free;
    But with mocking scorn, and with crown of thorn,
    They bore Thee to Calvary.

    Refrain:
    Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
    There is room in my heart for Thee!

    4.
    When heav'n's arches shall ring, and her choirs shall sing, 
    At Thy coming to victory;
    May Thy voice call me home, saying, "Yet there is room,
    There is room at My side for thee."

    Refrain:  
    My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,
    When Thou comest and callest me.
