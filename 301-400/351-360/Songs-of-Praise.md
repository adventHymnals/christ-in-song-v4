    1.
    Songs of praise the angels sang;
    Heav'n with alleluias rang,
    When Jehovah;s work begun,
    When he spake and it was done.
    Songs of praise awoke the morn,
    When the Prince of Peace was born;
    Songs of praise arose, when he 
    Captive led captivity.

    2.
    Heav'n and earth shall pass away,
    Songs of praise shall crown that day;
    God will make new heav'n and earth,
    Songs of praise shall hail their birth.
    And can man alone be dumb
    Till that glorious kingdom come?
    No; the Church delights to raise
    Psalms and hymns and songs of praise.

    3.
    Saints below with heart and voice,
    Still in songs of praise rejoice;
    Learning here, by faith and love,
    Songs of praise to sing above.
    Hymns of glory, songs of praise,
    Father, unto thee we raise;
    Jesus, glory unto thee,
    With the Spirit ever be.
