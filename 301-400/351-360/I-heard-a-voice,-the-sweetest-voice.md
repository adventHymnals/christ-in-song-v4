    1.
    I heard a voice, the sweetest voice
    That ever mortal heard;
    O how it made my heart rejoice,
    And every feeling stirred!
    'Twas Jesus spoke to me so mild;
    He called me to his side,
    And said, although with heart defiled,
    I might in him confide.

    2.
    I saw his face, the fairest face
    That ever mortal saw;
    I longed the Saviour to embrace,
    From him new life to draw.
    "Come unto me," he kindly said,
    "And I will give thee rest;
    The ransom-price I fully paid;
    Repent!  believe!  be blest!"

    3.
    I felt his love, the strongest love
    That mortal ever felt;
    O, how it drew my soul above,
    And made my hard heart melt!
    My burden at his feet I laid,
    And knew the joy of heaven,
    As in my willing ear he said
    The blessed word, "Forgiven!"
