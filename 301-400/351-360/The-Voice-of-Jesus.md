    1.
    I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    "Come unto me and rest;
    Lay down; thou weary one lay down
    Thy head upon my breast."
    I came to Jesus as I was
    Weary, and worn, and sad;
    I found in him a resting place,
    And he has made me glad.

    2.
    I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
    "Behold, I freely give
    The living water; thirsty one,
    Stoop down and drink and live."
    I came to Jesus, and I drank
    Of that life-giving stream;
    My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
    And now I live in him.

    3.
    I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    "I am this dark world's light.
    Look unto me; thy morn shall rise,
    And all thy days be bright."
    I look'd to Jesus, and I found
    In him my star, my sun;
    And in that light of life I'll walk,
    Till all my journey's done.
