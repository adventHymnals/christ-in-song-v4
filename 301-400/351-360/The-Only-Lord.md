[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UeSoJMTrUFdicMZs_XVju_My0bnDipns/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O God, we praise thee, and confess
    That thou the only Lord
    And Everlasting Father art;
    By all be thou adored.
    To thee all angels cry aloud;
    To thee the pow'rs on high,
    Both cherubim and seraphim,
    Continually do cry,

    2.
    "O holy, holy, holy Lord,
    When heav'nly hosts obey,
    The universe is glory fill'd
    With thy majestic's sway!"
    The glad immortal company,
    Arrayed in robes of light,
    With all the saints in sinless worlds,
    Thy constant praise recite.

    3.
    The holy church thro'out the world,
    O Lord, confesses thee,
    That thou th' Eternal Father art,
    Of boundless majesty!
    Thee day by day we magnify,
    Thy mercy we implore,
    To keep us this day without sin,
    And guard us evermore.
