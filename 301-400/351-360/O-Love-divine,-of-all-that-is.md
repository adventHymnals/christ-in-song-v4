[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UkpueyBBF5Lap4t5mdPlBY2ihtd63bmB/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Love divine, of all that is,
    The sweetest and the best,
    Fain would I come and rest to-night
    Upon thy tender breast;
    I pray thee turn me not away;
    For, sinful though I be,
    Thou knowest ev'rything I need,
    And all my need of thee.

    2.
    And yet the spirit in my heart
    Says, Wherefore should I pray
    That thou shouldst seek me with thy love,
    Since thou dost seek alway?
    And dost not even wait until
    I urge my steps to thee;
    But in the darkness of my life
    Art coming still to me.

    3.
    Thou hearest ev'ry tho't I mean,
    And not the words I say,
    The hidden thanks among the words
    That only seen to pray.
    Still, still thy love will beckon me,
    And still thy strength will come
    In many ways to bear me up
    And bring me to my home.
