    1.
    Hark!  the herald angels sing,
    "Glory to the newborn King;
    Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
    God and sinners reconciled!"
    Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
    Join the triumph of the skies;
    With the angel host proclaim,
    "Christ is born in Bethlehem!"
    With the angel host proclaim,
    "Christ is born in Bethlehem!"

    2.
    Christ, by highest heav'n adored,
    Christ, the everlasting Lord;
    In the manger born a king,
    While adoring angels sing,
    "Peace on earth, to men good-will;"
    Bid the trembling soul be still,
    Christ on earth has come to dwell,
    Jesus, our Emmanuel!
    Christ on earth has come to dwell,
    Jesus, our Emmanuel!

    3.
    Hail!  the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
    Hail!  the Sun of righteousness!
    Life, and light to all he brings,
    Ris'n with healing in his wings.
    Mild he lays his glory by,
    Born that man no more may die,
    Born to raise the sons of earth,
    Born to give them second birth.
    Born to raise the sons of earth,
    Born to give them second birth.
