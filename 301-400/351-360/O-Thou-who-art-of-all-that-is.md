[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U7FIEeSMyh%2DIh6WDE8HbmPHvfdwJlEiD/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Thou who art of all that is
    Beginning and the end,
    We follow thee thro' unknown paths,
    Since all to thee must tend;
    Thy judgments are a mighty deep,
    Beyond all fathom line;
    Our wisdom is the child-like heart;
    Our strength, to trust in thine.

    2.
    We bless thee for the skies above,
    And for the earth beneath;
    For hopes that blossom here below,
    And wither not with death;
    But most ye bless thee for thyself,
    O heavenly Light within,
    Whose dayspring in our hearts, dispels
    The darkness of our sin.
