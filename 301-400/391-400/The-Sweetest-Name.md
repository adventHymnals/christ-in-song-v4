    1.
    There is no name so sweet on earth,
    No name so sweet in heaven,
    The name before his wondrous birth
    To Christ the Saviour given.

    Refrain:
    We love to sing around our King,
    And hail him blessed Jesus;
    For there's no word ear ever heard
    So dear, so sweet, as Jesus.

    2.
    And when he hung upon the tree,
    They wrote this name above him,
    That all might see the reason we
    For evermore must love him.  [Refrain]

    3.
    So now, upon his Father's throne,
    Almighty to release us
    From sin and pains, he ever reigns,
    The Prince and Saviour, Jesus.  [Refrain]
