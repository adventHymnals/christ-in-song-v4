    1.
    I would be, dear Saviour, wholly thine;
    Teach me how, teach me how;
    I would do thy will, O Lord, not mine,
    Help me, help me now.
    Wholly thine, wholly thine,
    Wholly thine, this is my vow.
    Wholly thine, wholly thine, wholly thine, O Lord, just now.

    2.
    What is worldly pleasure, wealth or fame,
    Without thee, without thee?
    I will leave them all for thy dear name,
    This my wealth shall be. 
    Wholly thine, wholly thine,
    Wholly thine, this is my vow.
    Wholly thine, wholly thine, wholly thine, O Lord, just now.

    3.
    As I cast earth's transient joys behind,
    Come thou near, come thou near;
    In thy presence all in all I find,
    'Tis my comfort here.
    Wholly thine, wholly thine,
    Wholly thine, this is my vow.
    Wholly thine, wholly thine, wholly thine, O Lord, just now.
