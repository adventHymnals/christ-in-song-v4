    1.
    We praise thee, O God, for the Son of thy love,
    For Jesus who died and is now gone above.

    Chorus:
    Hallelujah!  thine the glory,
    Hallelujah!  amen;
    Hallelujah!  thine the glory,
    Revive us again.

    2.
    We praise thee, O God, for thy Spirit of light,
    Who has shown us our Saviour, and scatter'd our night.  [Chorus]

    3.
    All glory and praise to the Lamb that was slain,
    Who has borne all our sins, and has cleans'd ev'ry stain.  [Chorus]

    4.
    All glory and praise to the God of all grace,
    Who has bought us, and sought us, and guided our ways.  [Chorus]

    5.
    Revive us again; fill each heart with thy love;
    May each soul be rekindled with fire from above.  [Chorus]
