[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PNllg03J6G5jDIF%2DxeZ2cPAZZzzEAp6T/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O, how happy are they
    Who their Saviour obey,
    And have laid up their treasure above!
    Tongue can never express
    The sweet comfort and peace
    Of a soul in its earliest love.

    2.
    That sweet comfort is mine,
    Since the favor divine
    I receiv'd thro' the blood of the Lamb;
    Since my heart first believ'd,
    What a joy I've receiv'd,
    What a heaven in Jesus' dear name.

    3.
    'Tis a heaven below
    My Redeemer to know;
    And the angels can do nothing more
    Than to fall at his feet,
    And the story repeat,
    And the Love of sinners adore.

    4.
    Jesus all the day long
    Is my joy and my song;
    O that all to this Refuge might fly!
    He hath loved me, indeed,
    He did suffer and bleed,
    To redeem such a rebel as I.

    5.
    On the wings of his love,
    I am carried above
    All my sin, and temptation, and pain;
    O, that all would believe,
    And by sin never grieve,
    And thus cause him to suffer again.
