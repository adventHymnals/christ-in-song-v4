    1.
    Sound, sound the truth abroad!
    Bear ye the word of God
    Through the wide world;
    Tell what our Lord has done,
    Tell how the day is won,
    And from his lofty throne
    Satan is hurled.

    2.
    Ye who, forsaking all
    At your loved Master's call,
    Comforts resign;
    Soon will your work be done,
    Soon will the prize be won;
    Brighter than yonder sun
    Then shall ye shine.
