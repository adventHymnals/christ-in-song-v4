    1.
    Rejoice and be glad, the Redeemer has come;
    Go look on his cradle, his cross, and his tomb.

    Chorus:
    Sound His praises, tell the story
    Of Him who was slain;
    Sound his praises, tell with gladness,
    He liveth again.
    Final:  He cometh again.

    2.
    Rejoice and be glad, for the Lamb that was slain,
    O'er death is triumphant, and liveth again.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Rejoice and be glad, for our King is on high,
    He pleadeth for us on his throne in the sky.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Rejoice and be glad, for he cometh again,
    He cometh in glory, the Lamb that was slain.  [Chorus]
