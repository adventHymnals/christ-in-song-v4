    1.
    When all thy mercies, O my God!
    My rising soul surveys,
    Transported with the view, 
    I'm lost in wonder, love, and praise.

    2.
    Unnumbered comforts to my soul
    Thy tender care bestowed,
    Before my infant heart discerned
    From whom those blessings flowed.

    3.
    Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
    My daily thanks employ;
    Nor is the least a cheerful heart,
    That tastes these gifts with joy.

    4.
    O, how can words with equal warmth
    The gratitude declare
    That glows within my raptured heart?
    But thou canst read it there.

    5.
    Through all eternity, to thee
    A joyful song I'll raise:
    But O, eternity's too short
    To utter all thy praise!
