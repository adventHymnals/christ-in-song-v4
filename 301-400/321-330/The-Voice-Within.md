    1.
    There lives a voice within me,
    Guest angel of my heart,
    Whose whisp'rings strive to win me
    To act a noble part.
    Up evermore it springeth
    Like some sweet melody.
    And evermore it singeth
    This song of songs to me:

    Chorus:
    This world is full of beauty,
    That points the soul above,
    And if we did our duty,
    It might be full of love.

    2.
    The leaf tongues of the forest,
    The flower lips of the sod,
    The birds that hymn their raptures
    Up to the throne of God;
    The summer wind that bringeth
    Joy over land and sea.
    Have each a voice that singeth
    This song of songs to me:  [Chorus]

    3.
    O voice of God most tender,
    O voice of God divine,
    Still be my heart's defender
    Till ev'ry tho't is Thine;
    My soul in gladness bringeth
    Its songs of praise to Thee,
    While all around me singeth
    This song of songs to me:  [Chorus]
