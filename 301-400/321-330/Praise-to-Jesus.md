    1.
    Come, praise your Lord and Saviour,
    In strains of holy mirth;
    Give thanks to him, O children,
    Who lived a child on earth.
    He loved the little children
    And call'd them to his side,
    His loving arms embraced them,
    And for their sake he died.

    2.
    Let boyhood loudly praise thee
    With songs of holy joy,
    For thou on earth didst sojourn,
    A pure and spotless boy.
    Make us like thee obedient,
    Like thee from evil free;
    Like thee in God's own temple;
    In happy home like thee.

    3.
    In thee all gentlest graces
    Are gathered into one.
    O give that best adornment
    Which Christian maid can wear,
    The meek and quiet spirit,
    Which shone in thee so fair.

    4.
    To thee, with voices blended,
    We sing our songs of praise:
    Be thou the light and pattern
    Of all our childhood days;
    And lead us ever onward,
    That, while we stay below,
    We may like thee, O Jesus,
    In grace and wisdom grow.
