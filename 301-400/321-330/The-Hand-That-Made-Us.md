    1.
    The spacious firmament on high,
    With all the blue, ethereal sky,
    And spangled heav'ns, a shining frame,
    Their great Original proclaim:
    Th' unwearied sun, from day to day
    Does his Creator's pow'r display,
    And publishes to ev'ry land
    The work of an almighty hand.

    2.
    Soon as the evening shades prevail,
    The moon takes up the wondrous tale;
    And nightly, to the list'ning earth
    Repeats the story of her birth;
    While all the stars that round her burn,
    And all the planets in their turn,
    Confirm the tidings as they roll,
    And spread the truth from pole to pole.

    3.
    What tho' in solemn silence, all
    Move round the dark terrestrial ball?
    What tho' no real voice nor sound
    Amid their radiant orbs be found!
    In reason's ear they all rejoice,
    And utter forth a glorious voice,
    Forever singing as they shine,
    "The hand that made us is divine."
