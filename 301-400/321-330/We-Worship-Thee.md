    1.
    O Saviour, precious Saviour,
    Whom yet unseen we love,
    O Name of might and favor,
    All other names above!
    We worship Thee, we bless Thee,
    To thee, O Christ, we sing;
    We praise thee, and confess Thee
    Our holy Lord and King.

    2.
    O bringer of salvation,
    Who wondrously hast wrought,
    Thyself the revelation 
    Of love beyond our tho't,
    We worship Thee, we bless Thee,
    To Thee, O Christ, we sing;
    We praise Thee, and confess Thee
    Our gracious Lord and King.

    3.
    In Thee all fulness dwelleth,
    All grace and pow'r divine;
    The glory that excelleth,
    O Son of God is Thine;
    We worship Thee, we bless thee,
    To thee, O Christ, we sing;
    We praise Thee, and confess Thee
    Our glorious Lord and King.

    4.
    Oh, grant the consummation
    Of this our song above,
    In endless adoration,
    And everlasting love;
    Then shall we praise and bless Thee
    Where perfect praises ring,
    And evermore confess Thee
    Our Saviour and our King.
