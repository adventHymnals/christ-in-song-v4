    1.
    O Word of God incarnate,
    O Wisdom from on high,
    O Truth unchanged, unchanging,
    O Light of our dark sky!
    We praise Thee for the radiance
    That from the hallow'd page,
    A lamp to guide our footsteps,
    Shine on from age to age.

    2.
    The Church from her dear Master
    Received the gift divine,
    And still that light she lifteth
    O'er all the earth to shine;
    It is the golden casket
    Where gems of truth are stored,
    It is the heav'n drawn picture
    Of Christ, the living Word.

    3.
    It floateth like a banner
    Before God's host unfurled:
    It shineth like a beacon
    Above the darkling world;
    It is the chart and compass
    That o'er life's surging sea,
    Mid mists and rocks and quicksands,
    Still guides, O Christ, to Thee.

    4.
    O make Thy Church, dear Saviour,
    A lamp of purest gold,
    To bear before the nations
    Thy true light as of old;
    O teach Thy wand'ring pilgrims
    By this their path to trace,
    Till, clouds and darkness ended,
    They see Thee face to face.  Amen.
