    1.
    When, His salvation bringing,
    To Zion Jesus came,
    The children all stood singing
    "Hosanna" to his name.
    Nor did their zeal offend him,
    But, as he rode along,
    He let them still attend him
    And smiled to hear their song.

    2.
    And, since the Lord retaineth
    His love for children still,
    Tho' now as King he reigneth
    On Zion's heav'nly hill,
    We'll flock around his banner,
    Who sits upon the throne,
    And cry aloud, "Hosanna
    To David's royal Son."

    3.
    For, should we fail proclaiming
    Our great Redeemer's praise,
    These stones, our silence shaming,
    Would their hosannas raise.
    But shall we only render
    The tribute of our words?
    Nor, while our hearts are tender,
    They too shall be the Lord's.
