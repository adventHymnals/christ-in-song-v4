    1.
    To Thee, O dear, dear Saviour!
    My spirit turns for rest,
    My peace is in Thy favor,
    My pillow on Thy breast;
    Tho' all the world deceive me,
    I know that I am Thine,
    And Thou wilt never leave me,
    O blessed Saviour mine.

    2.
    In Thee my trust abideth,
    On Thee my hope relies,
    O Thou whose love provideth
    For all beneath the skies;
    It was Thy mercy found me,
    From bondage set me free,
    And then for ever bound me
    With threefold cords to Thee.

    3.
    My grief is in the dullness
    With which this sluggish heart
    Doth open to the fullness
    Of all Thou wouldst impart;
    My hope is in Thy beauty
    Of holiness divine,
    My joy is in the duty
    That binds my life in Thine.  Amen
