    1.
    I sing the mighty pow'r of God,
    That made the mountains rise,
    That spread the flowing seas abroad,
    And built the lofty skies;
    I sing the wisdom that ordained
    The sun to rule the day;
    The moon shines full at his command,
    And all the stars obey.

    2.
    I sing the goodness of the Lord,
    That filled the earth with food;
    He formed the creatures with his word,
    And then pronounced them good.
    Lord, how thy wonders are displayed
    Where'er I turn my eye!
    If I survey the ground I tread,
    Or gaze upon the sky!

    3.
    There's not a plant or flow'r below
    But makes thy glories known;
    And clouds arise, and tempests blow,
    By order from thy throne.
    Creatures that borrow life from thee
    Are subject to thy care;
    There's not a place where we can flee
    But God is present there.
