    1.
    Worthy, worthy, is the Lamb,
    Worthy, worthy is the Lamb;
    Worthy, worthy is the Lamb
    That was slain.

    Chorus:
    Glory, hallelujah!  
    Praise him, hallelujah!
    Glory, hallelujah
    To the Lamb!

    2.
    Saviour, let thy kingdom come!
    Now the pow'r of sin consume;
    Bring thy blest millennium,
    Holy Lamb.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Thus may we each moment feel,
    Love him, serve him, praise him still,
    Till we all on Zion's hill
    See the Lamb.  [Chorus]
