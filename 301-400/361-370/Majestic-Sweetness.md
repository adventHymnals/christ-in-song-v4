[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PtpfvinsGDXR2DDT4z7vWLk5UuT97Ocw/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Majestic sweetness sits enthron'd
    Upon the Saviour's brow;
    His head with radiant light is crown'd,
    His lips with grace o'erflow,
    His lips with grace o'erflow.

    2.
    No mortal can with him compare,
    Among the sons of men;
    Fairer is he than all the fair
    That fill the heav'nly train,
    That fill the heav'nly train.

    3.
    He saw me plung'd in deep distress,
    He flew to my relief;
    For me he bore the shameful cross,
    And carried all my grief,
    And carried all my grief.

    4.
    To him I owe my life and breath,
    And all the joys I have;
    He makes me triumph over death,
    He saves me from the grave,
    He saves me from the grave.

    5.
    To heaven, the place of his abode,
    He brings my weary feet;
    Shows me the glories of my God,
    And makes my joy complete.

    6.
    Since from his bounty I receive
    Such proofs of love divine,
    Had I a thousand hearts to give,
    Lord, they should all be thine.
