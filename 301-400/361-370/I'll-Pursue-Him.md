    1.
    Jesus, my all to heav'n has gone,
    He whom I fix my hopes upon;
    His track I see, and I'll pursue
    The narrow way till him I view.

    Refrain:
    I'll pursue him, I'll pursue him,
    Yes, I'll pursue my Lord and King.

    2.
    This is the way I long have sought,
    And mourned because I found it not;
    My brief a burden long has been,
    Because I was not saved from sin.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Now will I tell to all around,
    What a dear Saviour I have found;
    I'll point to thy redeeming blood,
    And say, "Behold the way to God."  [Refrain]
