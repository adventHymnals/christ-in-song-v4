    1.
    Let all the heathen writers join
    To form one perfect book;
    Great God, if once compared with thine,
    How mean their writings look!
    How mean their writings look!

    2.
    Not the most perfect rules they gave
    Could show one sin forgiv'n,
    Nor lead one step beyond the grave;
    But thine conducts to heaven.
    But thine conducts to heaven.

    3.
    Yet men would fain be just with God
    By works their hands have wrought;
    But thy commands, exceeding broad,
    Extend to every thought.
    Extend to every thought.

    4.
    Our faith, and love, and every grace,
    Fall far below thy word;
    But perfect truth and righteousness
    Dwell only in the Lord.
    Dwell only in the Lord.
