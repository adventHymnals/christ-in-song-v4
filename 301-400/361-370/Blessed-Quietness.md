    1.
    Joys are flowing like a river,
    Since the Comforter has come;
    He abides with us forever,
    Makes the trusting heart his home.

    Chorus:
    Blessed quietness, holy quietness, 
    Sweet assurance in my soul;
    On the stormy sea,
    Jesus speaks to me,
    And the billows cease to roll.

    2.
    O what holy peace and gladness!
    What a comfort is our Guest,
    No more unbelief and sadness,
    As obeying now we rest.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Like the rain that falls from heaven,
    Like the sunlight from the sky,
    So the Holy Ghost is given,
    Coming gently from on high.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Lo!  a fruitful field is growing,
    Blessed fruits of righteousness;
    And the streams of life are flowing
    In the lonely wilderness.  [Chorus]

    5.
    What a wonderful salvation,
    Where we always see his face!
    What a peaceful habitation!
    What a quiet resting place!  [Chorus]
