    1.
    A glory gilds the sacred page,
    Majestic, like the sun;
    It gives a light to every age,
    It gives, but borrows none.
    It gives, but borrows none.

    2.
    The Spirit breathes upon the word,
    And brings the truth to sight;
    Precepts and promises afford
    A sanctifying light.
    A sanctifying light.

    3.
    The hand that gave it, still supplies
    The gracious light and heat;
    His truths upon the nations rise,
    They rise, but never set.
    They rise, but never set.

    4.
    Let everlasting thanks be thine,
    For such a bright display;
    It makes a world of darkness shine
    With beams of heav'nly day.
    With beams of heav'nly day.
