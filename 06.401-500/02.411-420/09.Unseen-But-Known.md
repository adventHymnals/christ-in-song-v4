####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Jesus, these eyes have never seen
That radiant form of Thine;
The vail of sense hangs dark between
Thy blessed face and mine.

2.
I see Thee not, I hear Thee not,
Yet art Thou oft with me;
And earth has ne'er so dear a spot,
As where I meet with Thee.

3.
Like some bright dream that comes unsought,
When slumbers o'er me roll,
Thine image ever fills my tho't,
And charms my ravished soul.

4.
Yet tho' I have not seen, and still
Must rest in faith alone,
I love Thee, dearest Lord, and will,
Unseen, but not known.
