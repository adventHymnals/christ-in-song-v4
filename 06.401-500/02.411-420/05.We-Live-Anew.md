####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Baptized into our Saviour's death,
Our souls to sin must die;
With Christ our Lord we live anew,
With Christ ascend on high,
With Christ ascend on high.

2.
There by his Father's side he sits,
Enthroned divinely fair;
Yet owns himself our Brother still,
And our forerunner there,
And our forerunner there.

3.
Rise from these earthly trifles, rise
On wings of faith and love;
Above, our choicest treasure lies,
And be our hearts above,
And be our hearts above.
