## 413. FAITH VIEWS HIM
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Buried beneath the yielding wave
The great Redeemer lies;
Faith views him in the watery grave,
And thence beholds him rise.

2.
Thus do these willing souls today
Their ardent zeal express,
And in the Lord's appointed way
Fulfill all righteousness.

3.
With joy we in his footsteps tread,
And would his cause maintain;
Like him be numbered with the dead,
And with him rise and reign.

```
