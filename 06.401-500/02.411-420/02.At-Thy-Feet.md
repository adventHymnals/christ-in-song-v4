## 412. AT THY FEET
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O Lord, who hidest all our shame
Beneath thy crimsoned hand,
We feel thy touch, we trust thy name,
We yield to thy command.

2.
We had no courage in the strife,
No shelter in retreat;
But thou hast glorified our life,
We lay it at thy feet.

3.
Be thou our King our hearts are thine
Do with us as thou wilt,
So nevermore thy love divine
Be wounded for our guilt.

4.
We ask no ease nor joyous hours
To use for self alone;
Take thou our thoughts, our ransomed pow'rs,
And make them all thine own.

```
