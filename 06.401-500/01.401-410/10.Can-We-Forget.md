#### Advent Hymnals
## 410. CAN WE FORGET?
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Jesus, thy love can we forget,
And never bring to mind
The grace that paid our hopeless debt,
And bade us pardon find?

2.
Shall we thy life of grief forget,
Thy fasting and thy pray'r,
Thy locks with mountain vapors wet,
To save us from despair?

3.
Gethsemane can we forget
Thy struggling agony
When night lay dark on Olivet,
And none to watch with thee?

4.
Our sorrows and our sins were laid
On Thee, alone on thee;
Thy precious blood our ransom paid
Thine all the glory be!

```
