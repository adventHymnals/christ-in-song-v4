####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Our Saviour's voice is soft and sweet,
When, bending from above,
He bids us gather round His feet,
And calls us by His love.

2.
He leads to heav'n where angels dwell,
He saves from endless woe;
Our lips, our lives, can never tell
How much to Christ we owe.

3.
But while our youthful hearts rejoice,
That thus He bids us come,
Jesus, we cry with pleading voice,
Bring heathen wand'rers home.

4.
They never heard the Saviour's name,
They have not learnt His way,
They do not know His grace who came
To take their sins away.

5.
Dear Saviour, let the joyful sound,
In distant lands be heard;
And oh, wherever sin is found,
Send forth Thy pard'ning word.

6.
And if our lips may breathe the pray'r,
Tho' raised in trembling fear,
Oh, let Thy pow'r our hearts prepare,
And choose some heralds here.
