## 404. BLESS THE LORD
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Stand up, and bless the Lord,
Ye people of his choice;
Stand up, and bless the Lord your God,
With heart, and soul, and voice.

2.
Tho' high above all praise,
Above all blessing high,
Who would not fear his holy name,
And laud and magnify?

3.
O for the living flame
From his own altar brought,
To touch our lips, our souls inspire,
And wing to heav'n our thought!

4.
God is our strength and song,
And his salvation ours;
Then be his love in Christ proclaimed
With all our ransom'd pow'rs.
