## 403. THE KING OF LOVE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The King of love my Shepherd is,
Whose goodness faileth never;
I nothing lack if I am His,
And He is mine forever.

2.
Where streams of living water flow
My ransomed soul He leadeth,
And where the verdant pastures grow,
With food celestial feedeth.

3.
Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed,
But yet in love He sought me,
And on His shoulder gently laid,
and home, rejoicing, brought me.

4.
And so thro' all the length of days
Thy goodness faileth never
Good Shepherd!  I would sing Thy praise
Within Thy house forever.
