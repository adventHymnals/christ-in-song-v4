####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The Lord be with us as we bend
His blessing to receive;
His gift of peace upon us send,
Before his courts we leave.

2.
The Lord be with us as we walk
Along our homeward road;
In silent thought or friendly talk
Our hearts be still with God.

3.
The Lord be with us till the night
Enfold us all to rest;
Be he of ev'ry heart the light,
Of ev'ry home the guest.

```
