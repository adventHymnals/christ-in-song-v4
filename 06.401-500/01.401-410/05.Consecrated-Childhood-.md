#### Advent Hymnals
## 405. CONSECRATED CHILDHOOD 
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
By cool Siloam's shady rill
How fair the lily grows!
How sweet the breath, beneath the hill,
Of Sharon's dewy rose!

2.
Lo, such the child whose early feet
The paths of peace have trod,
Whose secret heart, with influence sweet,
Is upward drawn to God.

3.
Dependent on thy bounteous breath,
We seek thy grace alone
In childhood, manhood, age, and death,
To keep us still thine own.
