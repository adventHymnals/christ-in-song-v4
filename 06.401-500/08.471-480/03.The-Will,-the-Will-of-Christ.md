        Christ in Song 473. The Will, the Will of Christ. Around the world the chorus rings, And hands are joined with hands; A Brotherhood of Service sings In all the happy lands; United sounds the watchword still That ever has sufficed;  "The will, the will, the blessed will! The will of Jesus Christ!"

## 473. THE WILL, THE WILL OF CHRIST
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Around the world the chorus rings,
And hands are joined with hands;
A Brotherhood of Service sings
In all the happy lands;
United sounds the watchword still
That ever has sufficed; 
"The will, the will, the blessed will!
The will of Jesus Christ!"

2.
In crowded town or lonely plain,
'Mid many friends or few,
With man's applause or man's disdain,
To one allegiance true,
That sole desire their hearts could fill,
Tho' all the earth enticed;
The will, the will, the precious will!
The will of Jesus Christ!"

3.
When proud Ambition gilds her goal,
When Ease to slumber calls,
When silken Mammon lures the soul
To rainbow-tinted halls,
The Brotherhood of Service still
Exalts the Pearl unpriced;
The will, the will, the holy will!
The will of Jesus Christ!"

4.
And when at last the golden years
Have brought the crowning day,
When toil and trial, pain and fears,
Forever pass away,
Upon the summit of the hill
Is One that keepeth tryst;
'Tis He, the Will, the living Will!  
Our Master, Jesus Christ!"
