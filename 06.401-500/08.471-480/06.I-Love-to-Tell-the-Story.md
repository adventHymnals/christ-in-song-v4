```txt
1.
I love to tell the story
Of unseen things above;
Of Jesus and his glory,
Of Jesus and his love;
I love to tell the story,
Because I know 'tis true,
It satisfies my longing
As nothing else can do.

Chorus:
I love to tell the story;
'Twill be my theme in glory
To tell the old, old story
Of Jesus and his love.

2.
I love to tell the story;
More wonderful it seems
Than all the golden fancies
Of all our golden dreams;
I love to tell the story,
It did so much for me,
And that is just the reason
I tell it now to thee.  [Chorus]

3.
I love to tell the story;
'Tis pleasant to repeat
What seems each time I tell it,
More wonderfully sweet;
I love to tell the story,
For some have never heard
The message of salvation
From God's own holy word.  [Chorus]

4.
I love to tell the story;
For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
To hear it like the rest;
And when in scenes of glory
I sing the new, new song,
'Twill be the old, old story
That I have loved so long.  [Chorus]

```
