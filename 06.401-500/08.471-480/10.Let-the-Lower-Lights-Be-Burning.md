####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Brightly beams our Father's mercy,
From His lighthouse evermore,
But to us He gives the keeping
Of the lights along the shore.

Chorus:
Let the lower lights be burning!
Send a gleam across the wave!
Some poor fainting, struggling seaman
You may rescue, you may save.

2.
Dark the night of sin has settled,
Loud the angry billows roar;
Eager eyes are watching, longing,
For the lights along the shore.  [Chorus]

3.
Trim your feeble lamp, my brother
Some poor sailor tempest tost,
Trying now to make the harbor,
In the darkness may be lost.  [Chorus]

```
