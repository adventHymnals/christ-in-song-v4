####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying,
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
Weep o'er the erring one,
Lift up the fallen,
Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.

Chorus:
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.

2.
Tho' they are slighting him,
Still he is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive.
Plead with them earnestly,
Plead with them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.  [Chorus]

3.
Down in the human heart,
Crush'd by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
Touched by a loving heart,
Wakened by kindness,
Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.  [Chorus]

4.
Rescue the perishing,
Duty demands it,
Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
Back to the narrow way
Patiently win them;
Tell the poor wand'rer a Saviour has died.  [Chorus]
