## 440. PRAISE FOR TRUTH
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Praise to Him by whose kind favor
Heav'nly truth has reached our ears;
May its sweet reviving savor
Fill our hearts and calm our fears.

2.
Truth!  how sacred is the treasure!
Teach us, Lord, its worth to know;
Vain the hope, and short the pleasure
Which from other sources flow.

3.
What of truth we have been hearing,
Fix, O Lord, in ev'ry heart;
In the day of thy appearing
May we share thy people's part.
