## 439. JOIN OUR SONGS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Come, let us join our cheerful songs
With angels round the throne;
Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,
But all their joys are one;
But all their joys are one.

2.
Worthy the Lamb who died, they cry,
To be exalted thus;
Worthy the Lamb, our hearts reply,
For he was slain for us;
For he was slain for us.

3.
Jesus is worthy to receive
Honor and pow'r divine;
And blessings more than we can give,
Be, Lord, forever thine;
Be, Lord, forever thine.

```
