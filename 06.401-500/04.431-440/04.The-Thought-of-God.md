## 434. THE THOUGHT OF GOD
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
One thot' I have, my ample creed,
So deep it is and broad;
And equal to my ev'ry need,
It is the tho't of God.

2.
Each morn unfolds some fresh surprise,
I feast at life's full board;
And rising in my inner skies,
Shines forth the tho't of God.

3.
At night my gladness is my pray'r;
I drop my daily load,
And ev'ry care is pillowed there
Upon the tho't of God.

4.
I ask not far before to see,
But take in trust my road;
Life, death, and immortality
Are in my tho't of God
