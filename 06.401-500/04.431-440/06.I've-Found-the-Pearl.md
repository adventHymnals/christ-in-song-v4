####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I've found the Pearl of greatest price!
My heart doth sing for joy;
And sing I must, for Christ is mine!
He shall my song employ,
He shall my song employ.

2.
Christ is my Prophet, Priest, and King;
My prophet full of light,
My great High Priest before the throne,
My King of heav'nly might,
My King of heav'nly might.

3.
Christ is my peace; he died for me,
For me he shed his blood;
And as my wondrous Sacrifice,
Offered himself to God,
Offered himself to God.

4.
Christ Jesus is my all in all,
My comfort and my love;
My life below, and he shall be
My joy and crown above,
My joy and crown above.
