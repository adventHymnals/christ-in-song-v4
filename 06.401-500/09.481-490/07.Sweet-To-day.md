####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I cease to sing of sweet tomorrow,
With selfish thought to be away;
There is a holier balm for sorrow,
I find in Christ a sweet to-day.

Refrain:
A risen Christ, a living Saviour,
Not in the tomb where once he lay.
Whene'er I tell his loving favor,
Sweet by and by is ev'ry day.

2.
I am so happy when I'm telling
How great his pow'r, how great his love;
Were there no praise where God is dwelling,
It would be pain to live above.  [Refrain]

3.
If but to gain a home in glory
The Saviour trod this earth alone,
There ne'er had been a gospel story,
He ne'er had left his royal throne.  [Refrain]

4.
His love is life, his love is heaven
Eternal life, eternal bliss;
Accept it freely, be forgiven,
And taste the future world in this.  [Refrain]
