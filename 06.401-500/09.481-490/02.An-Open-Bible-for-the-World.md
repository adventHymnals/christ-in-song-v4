```txt
1.
An open Bible for the world!
May this our glorious motto be!
On ev'ry breeze the truth unfurled
Shall scatter blessings rich and free.

Chorus:
Blest word of God!  send forth thy light
O'er ev'ry land and ev'ry sea,
Till all who wander in the night
Are led to God and heav'n by thee.

2.
Where'er it goes its golden light,
Streaming as from unveiled sun,
Shall dissipate the clouds of night,
Undo the work that sin has done.  [Chorus]

3.
It shows to men the Father's face,
All radiant with forgiving love;
And to the lost of Adam's race,
Proclaims sweet mercy from above.  [Chorus]

4.
It tells of Jesus and his death,
Of life procured for dying men;
And to each soul of humble faith,
Gives sonship with the Lord again.  [Chorus]

5.
It offers rest to weary hearts;
It comforts those who sit in tears;
To all who faint it strength imparts;
And gilds with hope th' eternal years.  [Chorus]
