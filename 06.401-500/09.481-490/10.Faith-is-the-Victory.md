        Christ in Song 490. Faith is the Victory. Encamped along the hills of light, Ye Christian soldiers, rise, And press the battle ere the night Shall veil the glowing skies; Against the foe in vales below, Let all our strength be hurled; Faith is the victory, we know, That overcomes the world. Chorus: Faith is the victory! Faith is the victory; Oh, glorious victory, That overcomes the world.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Encamped along the hills of light,
Ye Christian soldiers, rise,
And press the battle ere the night
Shall veil the glowing skies;
Against the foe in vales below,
Let all our strength be hurled;
Faith is the victory, we know,
That overcomes the world.

Chorus:
Faith is the victory!
Faith is the victory;
Oh, glorious victory,
That overcomes the world.

2.
His banner over us is love,
Our sword the word of God;
We tread the road the saints above
With shouts of triumph trod;
By faith they, like a whirlwind's breath,
Swept on o'er ev'ry field;
The faith by which they conquered Death
Is still our shining shield.  [Chorus]

3.
On ev'ry hand the foe we find
Drawn up in dread array;
Let tents of ease be left behind,
And onward to the fray;
Salvation's helmet on each head,
With truth all girt about,
The earth shall tremble 'neath our tread,
And echo with our shout.  [Chorus]

4.
To him that overcomes the foe,
White raiment shall be giv'n;
Before the angels he shall know
His name confessed in heav'n;
Then onward from the hills of light,
Our hearts with love aflame;
We'll vanquish all the hosts of night,
In Jesus' conqu'ring name.  [Chorus]
