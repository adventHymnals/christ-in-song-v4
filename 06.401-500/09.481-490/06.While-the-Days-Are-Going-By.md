        Christ in Song 486. While the Days Are Going By. There are lonely hearts to cherish, While the days are going by; There are weary souls who perish, While the days are going by; If a smile we can renew, As our journey we pursue, O, the good we all may do, While the days are going by!

#### Advent Hymnals
## 486. WHILE THE DAYS ARE GOING BY
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
There are lonely hearts to cherish,
While the days are going by;
There are weary souls who perish,
While the days are going by;
If a smile we can renew,
As our journey we pursue,
O, the good we all may do,
While the days are going by!

Refrain:
Going by, going by,
Going by, going by;
O, the good we all may do,
While the days are going by!

2.
There's no time for idle scorning,
While the days are going by;
Let your face be like the morning,
While the days are going by;
For the world is full of sighs,
Full of sad and weeping eyes;
Help your fallen brother rise,
While the days are going by.  [Refrain]

3.
All the loving links that bind us,
While the days are going by;
One by one we leave behind us,
While the days are going by;
But the seeds of good we sow,
Both in shade and shine will grow,
And will keep our hearts aglow,
While the days are going by.  [Refrain]
