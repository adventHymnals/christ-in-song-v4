####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Are you Christ's light bearer?
Of his joy a sharer?
Is this world fairer
For your cheering ray?
Is your beacon lighted,
Guiding souls benighted
To the land of perfect day?

Chorus:
O brother!  is your lamp trimm'd and burning?
Is the world made brighter by its cheering ray?
Are you wailing, yearning 
For your Lord's returning?
Are you watching day by day?

2.
Is your heart warm, glowing,
With his love o'er flowing,
And his goodness showing
More and more each day?
Are you pressing onward
With his faithful vanguard,
In the safe and narrow way?  [Chorus]

3.
Keep your altars burning,
Wait your Lord's returning, 
While your heart's deep yearning
Draws him ever near;
With his radiance splendid
Shall your light be blended
When his glory shall appear.  [Chorus]
