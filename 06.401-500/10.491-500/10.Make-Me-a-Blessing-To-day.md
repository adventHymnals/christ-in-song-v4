####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O softly the Spirit is whisp'ring to me,
With tender compassion, with pitying plea;
I hear His beseeching, and earnestly pray
That Jesus will make me a blessing to-day.

Chorus:
Lord, make me a blessing to-day,
A blessing to someone, I pray;
In all that I do, in all that I say,
O make me a blessing to-day.

2.
Some heart may be longing for only a word,
Whose love by the Spirit is quickened and stirred;
Now grant, blessed Saviour, this service to me,
Of speaking a comforting message for Thee.  [Chorus]

3.
Some soul may be plunged in the darkest despair,
Whose shadows would melt in the sunlight of pray'r; 
O give me, dear Saviour, I humbly implore,
The sweet consolation that soul to restore.  [Chorus]

4.
Come, all ye that labor, ye weary and worn,
Come ye who in sorrow or sinfulness mourn;
With me this petition to Jesus convey;
O make me a blessing, dear Saviour, to-day.  [Refrain]
