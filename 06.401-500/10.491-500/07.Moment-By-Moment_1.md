#### Advent Hymnals
## 497. MOMENT BY MOMENT_1
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Moment by moment, hour by hour,
Constantly trusting His keeping pow'r;
Day by day and week by week,
Only His praise my tongue shall speak.

Refrain:
Moment by moment, Helper is He,
Moment by monument dwelling in me;
Gently subduing powers of sin,
Wonderful Saviour is Christ within.

2.
Why for the body anxious thot'? 
Knowing He careth, sweet is my lot;
Mine is the asking, His the store,
Moment by moment, o'er and o'er.  [Refrain]

3.
Why should the spirit doubting weep?
What I've committed, surely He'll keep;
Mine is the trusting, His the pow'r,
Moment by moment, hour by hour.  [Refrain]

4.
Why for the resting sing or sigh,
Selfishly seeking mansions on high?
Earth needeth more of holy love,
Than all the universe above.  [Refrain]

```
