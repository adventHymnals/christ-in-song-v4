        Christ in Song 492. Does Jesus Care?. Does Jesus care when my heart is pain'd Too deeply for mirth or song; As the burdens press, And the cares distress, And the way grows weary and long? Chorus: O yes, He cares, I know He cares, His heart is touched with my grief; When the days are weary, The long nights dreary, I know my Saviour cares.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Does Jesus care when my heart is pain'd
Too deeply for mirth or song;
As the burdens press,
And the cares distress,
And the way grows weary and long?

Chorus:
O yes, He cares, I know He cares,
His heart is touched with my grief;
When the days are weary,
The long nights dreary,
I know my Saviour cares.

2.
Does Jesus care when my way is dark
With a nameless dread and fear?
As the daylight fades
Into deep night shades,
Does He care enough to be near?  [Chorus]

3.
Does Jesus care when I've tried and fail'd
To resist some temptation strong?
When in my deep grief
I find no relief,
Tho' my tears flow all the night long?  [Chorus]

4.
Does Jesus care when I've said "good-bye"
To the dearest on earth to me,
And my sad heart aches
'Till it nearly breaks
Is this aught to Him?  does He see?  [Chorus]
