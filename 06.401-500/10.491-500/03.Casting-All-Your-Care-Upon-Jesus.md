####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O blessed rest, when we recline
On never failing pow'r divine,
God's mighty arms enfolding us,
The arms that hold the universe!

Chorus:
Casting all your care upon Jesus,
Casting all your care upon Jesus,
Casting all your care upon Jesus,
For He careth, He careth for you.

2.
Almighty strength!  but stronger yet
The love that cannot us forget;
Unfathom'd ocean, calm and broad!
Amazing mercy of our God!  [Chorus]

3.
Beyond the mountain peaks that rise
Above the clouds and pierce the skies,
Look up!  the highest wonderful see,
God's love that fills eternity.  [Chorus]

4.
Who trusts His word hath clearest sight,
Who trusts His pow'r hath greatest might;
Who trust His love doth never bear
The heart of doubt, the brow of care.  [Chorus]

5.
Man faileth man in trouble's hour,
As fails at noon the feeble flow'r.
Who trusts in God, here and afar
Shines on, tho' faileth sun and star.  [Chorus]
