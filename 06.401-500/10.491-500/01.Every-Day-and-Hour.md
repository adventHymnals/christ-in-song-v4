```txt
1.
Saviour, more than life to me,
I am clinging, clinging close to Thee;
Let Thy precious blood applied,
Keep me ever, ever near Thy side.

Refrain:
Ev'ry day, ev'ry hour,
Let me feel Thy cleansing pow'r
May Thy tender love to me 
Bind me closer, closer, Lord to Thee.

2.
Thro' this changing world below,
Lead me gently, gently as I go,
Trusting Thee, I cannot stray,
I can never, never lose my way. [Refrain]

3.
I would love Thee more and more,
Till this fleeting, fleeting life is o'er,
Till my soul is lost in love 
In a brighter, brighter world above.  [Refrain]

```
