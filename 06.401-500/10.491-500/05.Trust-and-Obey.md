1.
When we walk with the Lord
In the light of his word,
What a glory he sheds on our way!
While we do his good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.

Chorus:
Trust and obey, 
for there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
but to trust and obey.

2.
Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But his smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt nor a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.  [Chorus]

3.
Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil he doth richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown nor a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.  [Chorus]

4.
But we never can prove
The delights of his love,
Until all on the altar we lay,
For the favor he shows,
And the joy he bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.  [Chorus]

5.
Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at his feet,
Or we'll walk by his side in the way;
What he says we will do,
Where he sends we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey.  [Chorus]
