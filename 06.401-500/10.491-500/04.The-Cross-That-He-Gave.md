        Christ in Song 494. The Cross That He Gave. The cross that he gave may be heavy, But it ne'er outweighs His grace; The storm that I fear may surround me, But it ne'er excludes His face. Chorus: The cross is not greater than His grace, The storm cannot hide His blessed face; I am satisfied to know That with Jesus here below, I can conquer ev'ry foe.

```txt
1.
The cross that he gave may be heavy,
But it ne'er outweighs His grace;
The storm that I fear may surround me,
But it ne'er excludes His face.

Chorus:
The cross is not greater than His grace,
The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
I am satisfied to know
That with Jesus here below,
I can conquer ev'ry foe.

2.
The thorns in my path are not sharper
Than composed his crown for me;
The cup that I drink not more bitter
Than he drank in Gethsemane.  [Chorus]

3.
The light of his love shineth brighter,
As it falls on paths of woe;
The toil of my work groweth lighter,
As I stoop to raise the low.  [Chorus]

4.
His will I have joy in fulfilling,
As I'm walking in his sight;
My all to the blood I am bringing,
It alone can keep me right.  [Chorus]
