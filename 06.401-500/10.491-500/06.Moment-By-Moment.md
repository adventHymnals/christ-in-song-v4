1.
Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;
Living with Jesus, a new life divine;
Looking to Jesus 'till glory doth shine,
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

Chorus:
Moment by moment I'm kept in His love;
Moment by moment I've life from above;
Looking to Jesus 'till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

2.
Never a trial that He is not there,
Never a burden that He doth not bear,
Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
Moment by moment I'm under His care.  [Chorus]

3.
Never a heartache, and never a groan,
Never a teardrop and never a moan;
Never a danger but there on the throne,
Moment by moment He thinks of His own.  [Chorus]

4.
Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
Jesus, my Saviour, abides with me still.  [Chorus]
