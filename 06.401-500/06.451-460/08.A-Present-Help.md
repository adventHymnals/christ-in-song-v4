## 458. A PRESENT HELP
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
We may not climb the heav'nly steeps,
To bring the Saviour down;
In vain we search the lowest deeps,
For Him no depths can drown.

2.
But warm, sweet, tender, even yet
A present help is He;
And faith has yet its Olivet,
And love, its Galilee.

3.
The healing of the seamless dress
Is by our beds of pain;
We touch Him in life's throng and press,
And we are whole again.

4.
Thro' Him the first fond pray'rs are said,
Our lips of childhood frame;
The last low whispers of our dead
Are burdened with His name.

5.
O Lord and Master of us all,
Whate'er our name or sign,
We own Thy sway, we bear Thy call,
We test our lives by Thine!
