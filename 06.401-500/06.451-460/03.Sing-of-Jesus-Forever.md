## 453. SING OF JESUS FOREVER
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Sing of Jesus, sing forever,
Of the love that changes never;
Who or what from Him can sever
Those He makes His own?

2.
With His precious blood He bought us;
When we knew Him not, He sought us,
And from all our wand'rings bro't us;
His the praise alone.

3.
Thro' the desert drear He leads us,
With the bread of heav'n He feeds us,
And thro' all the journey speeds us
To His glorious throne.

```
