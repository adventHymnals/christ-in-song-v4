#### Advent Hymnals
## 447. THE RISING DAY
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Once more, my soul, the rising day
Salutes thy waking eye;
Once more, my voice, thy tribute, pay
To Him who rules on high.

2.
Night unto night His name repeats,
The day renews the sound,
Wide as the heav'ns on which He sits
To turn the seasons round.

3.
O God, may all my hours be thine,
While I enjoy the light;
Then shall my sun in smiles decline,
And bring a peaceful night.

```
