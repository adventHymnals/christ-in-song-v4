## 441. BID OUR DOUBTINGS CEASE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Let thy Spirit, blessed Saviour,
Come and bid our doubtings cease;
Come, O come with love and favor,
Fill us all with joy and peace.

2.
Fearful dangers are around us,
Satan watches to destroy;
Lord, our foes would fain confound us;
O for us thy might employ!

3.
On thy word our souls are resting;
Taught by thee, thy name we love;
Sweetest of all names is Jesus;
How it doth our spirits move!
