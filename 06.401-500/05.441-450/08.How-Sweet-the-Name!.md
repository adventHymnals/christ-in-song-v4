#### Advent Hymnals
## 448. HOW SWEET THE NAME!
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
And drives away his fear.

2.
It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary, rest.

3.
Dear name!  the rock on which I build!
My shield and hiding place!
My never-failing treas'ry, filled
With boundless stores of grace.

```
