## 442. GOD OF LIGHT
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
God of light and matchless splendor,
Feeble tho' the praise we bring,
Let thy Spirit touch and tender
Ev'ry heart as now we sing.

2.
Heav'n above cannot contain thee;
At thy presence earth would flee;
And tho' ev'ry sin doth pain thee;
Still thy mercy spareth me!

3.
Grateful praise my tongue shall offer,
'Neath thy smile or 'neath thy rod;
Take the humble gift I proffer,
Heart, and mind, and strength, O God!

```
