####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Christ is ris'n, our Lord and King,
Let the whole creation sing;
Raise your joys and triumphs high;
Sing, ye heav'ns, let earth reply.

2.
Vain the stone, the watch, the seal,
Christ the mighty, to conceal;
Death in vain forbids him rise,
He hath opened paradise.

3.
Lead us, Lord, where thou hast led,
Thou, our High, exalted Head;
Made like thee, by thee we rise;
Ours the cross, the grave, the skies.
