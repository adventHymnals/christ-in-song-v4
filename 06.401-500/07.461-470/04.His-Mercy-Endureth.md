####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good;
for His mercy endureth forever.
O give thanks unto the God of gods;
for His mercy endureth forever.  

2.
O give thanks to the Lord of lords;
for His mercy endureth forever,
To Him who alone doeth great wonders:
for His mercy endureth forever.

3.
To Him that by wisdom made the heavens:
for His mercy endureth forever,
To Him that stretched out the earth above the waters;
for His mercy endureth forever.

4.
To Him that made great lights:
for His mercy endureth forever. 
The sun to rule by day: the moon and stars to rule by night:
for His mercy endureth forever. 

5.
Who remembered us in our low estate:
for His mercy endureth forever. 
And hath redeemed us from our enemies;
for His mercy endureth forever. 

6.
Who giveth food to all flesh:
for His mercy endureth forever. 
O give thanks unto the God of heaven:
for His mercy endureth forever. Amen.
