####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Our Father which art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name;
Thy kingdom come; 
Thy will be done 
on earth as it is in heaven;

2.
Give us this day our daily bread;
And forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors;

3.
And lead us not into temptation, 
but deliver us from evil;
For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, 
and the glory, forever.  Amen.

```
