## 429. WE THANK THEE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Father, we thank thee for the night,
And for the pleasant morning light;
For rest, and food, and loving care,
And all that makes the day so fair.

2.
Help us to do the things we should,
To be to others kind and good;
In all we do, at work or play,
To grow more loving ev'ry day.

```
