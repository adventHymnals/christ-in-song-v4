## 421. THE BEST OF DAYS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
This is the day of rest;
Our failing strength renew;
On weary brain and troubled breast
Shed thou thy fresh'ning dew.

2.
This is the day of peace;
Thy peace our spirits fill;
Bid thou the blasts of discord cease,
The waves of strife be still.

3.
This is the day of pray'r;
Let earth to heav'n draw near;
Lift up our hearts to seek there;
Come down to meet us here.

4.
This is the best of days;
Send forth thy quick'ning breath,
And wake dead souls to love and praise,
O Vanquisher of death!
