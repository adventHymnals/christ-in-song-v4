## 423. THY PRESENCE HERE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
God of the universe, to thee
These sacred walls we rear;
And now, with songs and bended knee,
Invoke thy presence here.

2.
When sad with care, by sin oppressed,
Here may the burdened soul
Beneath thy shelt'ring wing find rest;
Here make the wounded whole.

3.
And when the last long Sabbath morn
Upon the just shall rise,
May all who own thee here, be borne
To mansions in the skies.

```
