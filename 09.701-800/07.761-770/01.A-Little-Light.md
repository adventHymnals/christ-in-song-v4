## 761. A LITTLE LIGHT
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
God make my life a little light 
Within the world to glow.
A little flame that burneth bright,
Wherever I may go.

2.
God make my life a little flow'r,
That giveth joy to all,
Content to bloom in native bow'r,
Altho' the place be small.

3.
God make my life a little song
That comforteth the sad;
That helpeth others to be strong,
And makes the singer glad.

4.
God make my life a little staff,
Whereon the weak may rest,
That so what health and strength I have
May serve my neighbors best.
