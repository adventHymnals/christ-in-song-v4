#### Advent Hymnals
## 766. HOW PRECIOUS!
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
How precious is the book divine,
By inspiration giv'n!
Bright as a lamp its doctrines shine,
To guide our souls to heav'n.

2.
It sweetly cheers our drooping hearts
In this dark vale of tears,
And life and light and joy imparts,
To banish all our fears.

3.
This lamp, thro' all the tedious night
Of life, shall guide our way,
Till we behold the clearer light
Of an eternal day.

```
