####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Holy Bible!  book divine!
Precious treasure, thou art mine!
Mine to tell me whence I came;
Mine to teach me what I am;

2.
Mine to chide me when I rove;
Mine to show a Saviour's love;
Mine to guide my wayward feet;
Mine to judge, condemn, acquit;

3.
Mine to comfort in distress,
If the Holy Spirit bless;
Mine to show by living faith,
Man can triumph over death;

4.
Mine to tell of joys to come,
In the saints' eternal home:
O thou holy Book divine,
Precious treasure, thou art mine!
