## 769. MY SHEPHERD
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want;
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green; he leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

2.
My soul He doth restore again;
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
Ev'n for his own name's sake.

3.
Yea, tho' I walk in death's dark vale,
Yet will I fear none ill;
For thou art with me; and thy rod
And staff do comfort still.

```
