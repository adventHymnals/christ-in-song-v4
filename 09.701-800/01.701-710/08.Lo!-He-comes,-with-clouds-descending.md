        Christ in Song 708. Lo!  He comes, with clouds descending. Lo!  He comes, with clouds descending, Once for favor'd sinners slain; Countless angels, him attending, Swell the triumph of his train: Hallelujah! Jesus comes and comes to reign.

## 708. LO!  HE COMES, WITH CLOUDS DESCENDING
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Lo!  He comes, with clouds descending,
Once for favor'd sinners slain;
Countless angels, him attending,
Swell the triumph of his train:
Hallelujah!
Jesus comes and comes to reign.

2.
Ev'ry eye shall now behold him
Robed in dreadful majesty!
Those who set at naught and sold him,
Pierced, and nailed him to the tree,
Deeply wailing,
Shall the true Messiah see.

3.
Yea, amen!  let all adore thee,
High on thy eternal throne!
Saviour, take the power and glory,
Make thy righteous sentence known:
O come quickly,
Claim the kingdom for thine own.
