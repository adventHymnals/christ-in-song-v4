## 701. ANYWHERE WITH JESUS_1
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Anywhere, dear Saviour,
In thy vineyard wide,
Where thou bidst me labor,
Lord, there would I abide.
Miracle of saving grace,
That thou givest me a place
Anywhere, dear Saviour, to work for thee.

2.
Where the night may find us,
Surely matters not;
If we camp with Jesus,
O blessed is the spot!
Quickly we the tent may fold,
Cheerful march thro' storm or cold,
Anywhere, dear Saviour, to work for thee.

3.
All along the journey,
Let us fix our eyes
On the "Rock of Ages,'
Until we gain the prize,
There the heart will make its home,
Willing led by thee to roam,
Anywhere, dear Saviour, to work for thee.
