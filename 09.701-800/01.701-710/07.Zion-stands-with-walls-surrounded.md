#### Advent Hymnals
## 707. ZION STANDS WITH WALLS SURROUNDED
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Zion stand with walls surrounded,
Zion, kept by pow'r divine:
All her foes shall be comfounded,
Though the world in arms combine:
Happy Zion,
What a favored lot is thine!

2.
Ev'ry human tie may perish;
Friend to friend unfaithful prove;
Mothers cease their own to cherish;
Heav'n and earth at last remove:
But no changes
Can attend Jehovah's love.

3.
In the furnace God may prove thee,
Thence to bring thee forth more bright;
But can never cease to love thee:
Thou art precious in his sight:
God is with thee,
God, thine everlasting light.
