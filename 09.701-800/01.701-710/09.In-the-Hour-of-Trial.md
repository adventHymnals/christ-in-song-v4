## 709. IN THE HOUR OF TRIAL
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
In the hour of trial,
Father, strengthen me;
Lest by base denial,
I depart from thee.
When thou see'st me waver,
With a touch recall,
Nor from thy dear favor,
Suffer me to fall.

2.
With forbidden pleasures
Would this vain world charm,
Or its sordid treasures 
Spread to work me harm;
By thy love sustaining,
Father keep thy child;
All my foes restraining,
And my passions wild.

3.
Should thy mercy send me
Sorrow, care, and woe;
Or should pain attend me
On my path below:
Grant that I may never
Fail thy hand to see;
Grant that I may ever
Cast my care on thee.  Amen.

```
