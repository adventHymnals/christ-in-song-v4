## 786. THE PURE IN HEART
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Blest are the pure in heart,
For they our God shall see,
And from his presence ne'er depart
Thro' all eternity.

2.
I will be their delight
Who here delight in me,
And they shall walk with me in white
Who seek for purity.

3.
No more in thought they err,
They're free from ev'ry stain;
They've wash'd their robes of character,
And spotless they remain.
