## 781. BE NOT AFRAID
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
When pow'r divine, in mortal form,
Hush'd with a word the raging storm,
In soothing accents Jesus said, 
"Lo, it is I; be not afraid."

2.
So when in silence nature sleeps,
And lonely watch the mourner keeps,
One thought shall ev'ry pang remove,
Trust, feeble man, thy Maker's love.

3.
And when the last dread hour shall come,
While trembling nature waits her doom,
This voice shall wake the righteous dead
"Lo, it is I; be not afraid."
