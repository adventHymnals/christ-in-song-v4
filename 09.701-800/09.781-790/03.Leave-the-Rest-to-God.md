## 783. LEAVE THE REST TO GOD
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
He who seeks the truth, and trembles
At the dangers he must brave,
Merits not the name of Freeman;
He at best is but a slave.

2.
Be thou like the noble ancients:
Scorn the threat that bids thee fear;
Speak!  no matter what betide thee;
Let them strike, but let them hear.

3.
Be thou like the first apostles,
Be thou like heroic Paul;
If a free thought seeks expression,
Speak it boldly!  speak it all!

4.
Fearlessly face thine accusers!
Scorn the prison, rack, or rod!
If thou hast a truth to utter,
Speak, and leave the rest to God.

```
