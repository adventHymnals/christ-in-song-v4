## 785. CONTROL MY WILL
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Prince of Peace, control my will,
Bid this struggling heart be still;
Bid my fears and doubtings cease,
Hush my spirit into peace.

2.
Thou hast bought me with thy blood,
Open'd wide the gate to God;
Peace, I ask, but peace must be,
Lord, in being one with thee.

3.
May thy will, not mine, be done,
May thy will and mine be one;
Chase these doubtings from my heart,
Now thy perfect peace impart.
