## 752. SOLDIERS OF CHRIST, ARISE!
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Soldiers of Christ, arise,
And put your armor on;
Fight, for the battle will be ours;
We fight to win a crown.

2.
We fight not against flesh,
We wrestle not with blood;
But principalities and pow'rs,
And for the truth of God;

3.
With wicked spirits, too,
That in high places stand,
Perverting oft the word of God,
And say 'tis by command.


```
