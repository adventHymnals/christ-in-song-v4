#### Advent Hymnals
## 759. HAPPY THE HOME
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Happy the home when God is there,
And love fills ev'ry breast;
When one their wish, and one their prayer.
And one their heav'nly rest.

2.
Happy the home where Jesus' name
Is sweet to ev'ry ear;
Where children early lisp his fame,
And parents hold him dear.

3.
Happy the home where prayer is heard,
And praise is wont to rise;
Where parents love the sacred word,
And live out for the skies.

4.
Lord, may we in our homes agree,
This blessed peace to gain;
Unite our hearts in love to thee,
And love to all will reign.

```
