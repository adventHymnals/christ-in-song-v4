## 745. ON THY CARE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
My spirit on thy care,
Blest Saviour, I recline;
Thou wilt not leave me to despair,
For thou art love divine.

2.
In thee I place my trust,
On thee I calmly rest;
I know thee good, I know thee just,
And count thy choice the best.

3.
Whate'er events betide,
Thy will they all perform;
Safe in thy breast my head I hide,
Nor fear the coming storm.

4.
Let good or ill befall,
It must be good for me,
Secure of having thee in all,
Of having all in thee.

```
