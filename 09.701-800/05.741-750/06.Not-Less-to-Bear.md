## 746. NOT LESS TO BEAR
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I ask not, Lord, for less to bear
Here in the narrow way,
But that I may thy blessing share
In all I do or say,
In all I do or say.

2.
With thee to lead, I will not fear
In scenes with danger rife,
While still thy cheering voice I hear,
"I am the Way, the Life,
I am the Way, the Life."

3.
Then help me to improve with care,
These precious moments giv'n;
For they a faithful record bear,
Of good or ill, to Heav'n,
Of good or ill, to Heav'n.

```
