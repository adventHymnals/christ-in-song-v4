####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Thus far the Lord has led me on;
Thus far his pow'r prolongs my days;
And ev'ry evening shall make known
Some fresh memorial of his grace.

2.
Much of my time has run to waste,
And I, perhaps, am near my home;
But he forgives my follies past,
And gives me strength for days to come.

3.
I lay my body down to sleep;
Peace is the pillow for my head;
While well-appointed angels keep
Their watchful stations round my bed.
