        Christ in Song 742. Gliding Swiftly By. My days are gliding swiftly by, And I, a pilgrim stranger, Would not detain them as they fly These hours of toil and danger; Chorus: For O, we stand on Jordan's strand, And soon we'll all pass over; And just before, the shining shore, We may almost discover.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
My days are gliding swiftly by,
And I, a pilgrim stranger,
Would not detain them as they fly
These hours of toil and danger;

Chorus:
For O, we stand on Jordan's strand,
And soon we'll all pass over;
And just before, the shining shore,
We may almost discover.

2.
We'll gird our loins, my brethren dear,
Our distant home discerning;
Our absent Lord has left us word,
Let ev'ry lamp be burning.  [Chorus]

3.
Should coming days be cold and dark,
We need not cease our singing;
That perfect rest naught can molest,
Where golden harps are ringing.  [Chorus]

4.
Let sorrow's rudest tempests blow,
Each cord on earth to sever,
Our King says, Come, and there's our home, 
Forever, O, forever!  [Chorus]

```
