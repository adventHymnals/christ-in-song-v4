        Christ in Song 741. Sweet Hour of Prayer. Sweet hour of pray'r, sweet hour of pray'r, That calls me from a world of care, And bids me, at my Father's throne Make all my wants and wishes known! In seasons of distress and grief, My soul has often found relief, And oft escaped the tempter's snare, By thy return, sweet hour of pray'r.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Sweet hour of pray'r, sweet hour of pray'r,
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me, at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known!
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of pray'r.

2.
Sweet hour of prayer!  sweet hour of prayer!
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless.
And since he bids me seek his face,
Believe his word, and trust his grace,
I'll cast on him my ev'ry care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

3.
Sweet hour of prayer!  sweet hour of prayer!
May I thy consolation share
Till from Mount Pisgah's lofty height
I view my home, and take my flight.
In my immortal flesh I'll rise
To seize the everlasting prize,
And shout while passing thro' the air,
"Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!"
