## 780. THE ONE THING NEEDFUL
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Jesus, engrave it on my heart
That thou the one thing needful art;
I could from all things parted be,
But never, never, Lord, from thee.

2.
Needful is thy most precious blood,
To reconcile my soul to God;
Needful in thy indulgent care,
Needful thy all prevailing prayer.

3.
Needful art thou, my Guide, my Stay,
Thro' all life's dark and weary way;
Nor will at last less needful be
To bring me home to heav'n and thee.

```
