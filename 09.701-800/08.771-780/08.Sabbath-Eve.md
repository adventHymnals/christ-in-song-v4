####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
How sweet the light of Sabbath eve!
How soft the sunbeams ling'ring there!
For these blest hours the world I leave,
Wafted on wings of faith and pray'r.

2.
Season of rest!  the tranquil soul
Feels the sweet calm, and melts in love;
And while these sacred moments roll,
Faith sees a smiling heav'n above.

3.
Nor will our days of toil be long;
Our pilgrimage will soon be trod;
And we shall join the ceaseless song,
The endless Sabbath of our God.
