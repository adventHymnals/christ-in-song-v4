####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Sun of my soul, O Saviour dear!
It is not night if thou be near:
O may no earth-born cloud arise
To hide thee from thy servant's eyes.

2.
When soft the dews of kindly sleep
My weary eyelids gently steep,
Be my fast thought bow sweet to rest
Forever on my Saviour's breast!

3.
Abide with me from morn till eve,
For without thee I cannot live;
Abide with me when night is nigh,
For without thee I dare not die.

4.
Be near and bless me when I wake,
Ere thro' the world my way I take;
Till in the ocean of thy love
I lose myself in heav'n above.

```
