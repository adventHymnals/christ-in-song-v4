## 771. ZION, AWAKE!
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Zion, awake!  thy slumber break;
No longer in thy sins lie down;
His garment of salvation take,
His beauty and His strength put on.

2.
Shake off the dust that blinds thy sight,
And hides the promise from thine eyes;
Arise, and struggle into light;
Thy great Deliv'rer calls, Arise!

3.
Vessels of mercy, sons of grace,
Be purged from ev'ry sinful stain;
Be like your Lord, his word embrace,
Nor bear his hallow'd name in vain.

```
