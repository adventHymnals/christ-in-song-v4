        Christ in Song 739. Kind Words Never Die. Kind words can never die, Cherish'd and blest; God knows how deep they lie, Stored in the breast, Like childhood's simple rhymes, Said o'er a thousand times, Yes, in all years and climes, Distant or near.

## 739. KIND WORDS NEVER DIE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Kind words can never die,
Cherish'd and blest;
God knows how deep they lie,
Stored in the breast,
Like childhood's simple rhymes,
Said o'er a thousand times,
Yes, in all years and climes,
Distant or near.

Refrain:
Kind words can never die,
Never die, never die;
Kind words can never die,
No, never die.

2.
Sweet thot's can never die,
Tho' like the flow'rs
Their brightest hues may fly
In wint'ry hours;
But when the gentle dew
Gives them their charms anew,
With many an added hue
They bloom again.

Refrain:
Sweet words can never die,
Never die, never die;
Sweet tho'ts can never die,
No, never die.

3.
True love can never die,
Tho' in the tomb
We all may silent lie,
Wrapp'd in its gloom;
Tho' mortal flesh decay,
There comes a glorious day,
When dust shall soar away
To Christ above.

Refrain:
True love can never die,
Never die, never die;
True love can never die,
No, never die.
