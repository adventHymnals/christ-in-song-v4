Pity dwelleth in thy bosom. Kindness reigneth o'er thy heart; Gentle thoughts alone can sway thee Judgment hath in thee no part.

#### Advent Hymnals
## 732. MEEK AND LOWLY, PURE AND HOLY
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Meek and lowly, pure and holy.
Chief among the blessed three.
Turning sadness into gladness,
Heav'n born art thou, charity!
Pity dwelleth in thy bosom.
Kindness reigneth o'er thy heart;
Gentle thoughts alone can sway thee
Judgment hath in thee no part.

2.
Hoping ever, failing never.
Though deceived, believing still;
Long abiding, all confiding
To thy heav'nly Father's will;
Never weary of well-doing.
Never fearful of the end;
Claiming all mankind as brothers,
Thou dost all alike befriend.
