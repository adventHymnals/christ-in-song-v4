        Christ in Song 735. Guard Thy Children. Gracious Father, guard thy children From the foe's destructive pow'r; Save O save them, Lord, from falling In this dark and trying hour. Thou wilt surely prove thy people, All our graces must be tried;  But thy word illumes our pathway, And in God we still confide.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Gracious Father, guard thy children
From the foe's destructive pow'r;
Save O save them, Lord, from falling
In this dark and trying hour.
Thou wilt surely prove thy people,
All our graces must be tried; 
But thy word illumes our pathway,
And in God we still confide.

2.
 We are in the time of waiting;
Soon we shall behold our Lord,
Wafted far away from sorrow,
To receive our rich reward.
Keep us, Lord, till thine appearing,
Pure, unspotted from the world;
Let thy Holy Spirit cheer us
Till thy banner is unfurled.
