#### Advent Hymnals
## 731. ALWAYS WITH US
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Always with us, always with us,
Words of cheer and words of love;
Thus the risen Saviour whispers,
From his dwelling place above.
With us when we toil in sadness,
Sowing much and reaping none;
Telling us that in the future, 
Golden harvest shall be won.

2.
With us when the storm is sweeping
O'er our pathway dark and drear;
Waking hope within our bosoms,
Stilling ev'ry anxious fear.
With us in the lonely valley,
When we cross the chilling stream;
Lighting up the gloomy shadows
With salvation's radiant beam.
