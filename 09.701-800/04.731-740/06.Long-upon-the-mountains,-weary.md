        Christ in Song 736. Long upon the mountains, weary. Long upon the mountains, weary. Have the scattered flock been torn; Dark the desert paths, and dreary; Grievous trials have they borne. Now the gath'ring call is sounding, Solemn in its warning voice; Union, faith, and love, abounding, Bid the little flock rejoice.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Long upon the mountains, weary.
Have the scattered flock been torn;
Dark the desert paths, and dreary;
Grievous trials have they borne.
Now the gath'ring call is sounding,
Solemn in its warning voice;
Union, faith, and love, abounding,
Bid the little flock rejoice.

2.
Now the light of truth they're seeking.
In its onward track pursue;
All the ten commandments keeping,
They are holy, just, and true.
On the words of life they're feeding,
Precious to their taste, so sweet;
All their Master's precepts heeding,
Bowing humbly at his feet.

3.
Soon He comes, with clouds descending;
All his saints, entombed, arise;
The redeemed, in anthems blending,
Shout their vict'ry thro' the skies.
O, we long for thine appearing!
Come, O Saviour, quickly come!
Blessed hope!  our spirits cheering,
Take thy ransomed children home.
