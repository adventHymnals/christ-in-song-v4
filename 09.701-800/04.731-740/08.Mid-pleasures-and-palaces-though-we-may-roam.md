        Christ in Song 738. Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam. Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam. Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home! A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there, Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.

## 738. MID PLEASURES AND PALACES THOUGH WE MAY ROAM
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam.
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home!
A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,
Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.

Refrain:
Home, home, sweet, sweet home;
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.

2.
An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain,
O give me my lowly thatched cottage again;
The birds singing gaily, that came at my call,
And with them, God's peace, which is dearer than all.  [Refrain]

```
