## 713. "MY TIMES ARE IN THY HAND:"
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
"My times are in thy hand:"
My God, I wish them there;
My life, my friends, my all I leave
Entirely to thy care.

2.
"My times are in thy hand:"
Why should I doubt or fear?
My Father's hand will never cause
His child a needless tear.

3.
"My times are in thy hand;"
I'll always trust in thee,
Till I possess the promised land,
And all thy glory see.

```
