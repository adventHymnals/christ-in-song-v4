        Christ in Song 720. The Night Is Coming. Work, for the night is coming, Work thro' the morning hours; Work while the dew is sparkling, Work 'mid springing flow'rs. Work when the day grows brighter, Work in the glowing sun; Work, for the night is coming, When man's work is done.

#### Advent Hymnals
## 720. THE NIGHT IS COMING
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Work, for the night is coming,
Work thro' the morning hours;
Work while the dew is sparkling,
Work 'mid springing flow'rs.
Work when the day grows brighter,
Work in the glowing sun;
Work, for the night is coming,
When man's work is done.

2.
Work, for the night is coming,
Work thro' the sunny noon;
Fill brightest hours with labor;
Rest comes sure and seen.
Give ev'ry flying minute
Something to keep in store;
Work, for the night is coming,
When man works no more.

3.
Work, for the night is coming
Under the sunset skies;
While their bright tints are glowing
Work, for daylight flies.
Work till the last beam fadeth,
Fadeth to shine no more;
Work while the night is dark'ning,
When man's work is o'er.

```
