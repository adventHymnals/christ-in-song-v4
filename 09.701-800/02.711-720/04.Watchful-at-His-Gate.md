####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Ye servants of the Lord,
Each in his office wait;
Observant of his heavn'ly word,
And watchful at his gate.
Observant of his heav'nly word,
And watchful at his gate.

2.
Let all your lamps be bright,
And trim the golden flame;
Gird up your loins as in his sight;
His coming thus proclaim.
Gird up your loins as in his sight;
His coming thus proclaim.

3.
Watch, 'tis your Lord's command,
And while we speak, he's near;
Mark the first signal of his hand,
And ready all appear.
Mark the first signal of his hand,
And ready all appear.

4.
O, happy servant he,
In such a posture found!
He shall his Lord with rapture see,
And be with honor crown'd.
He shall his Lord with rapture see,
And be with honor crown'd.
