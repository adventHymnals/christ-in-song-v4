        Christ in Song 719. The morning light is breaking. The morning light is breaking, The darkness disappears, The sons of earth are waking To penitential tears; Each breeze that sweeps the ocean Brings tidings from afar, Of nations in commotion, Prepared for Zion's war.

## 719. THE MORNING LIGHT IS BREAKING
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The morning light is breaking,
The darkness disappears,
The sons of earth are waking
To penitential tears;
Each breeze that sweeps the ocean
Brings tidings from afar,
Of nations in commotion,
Prepared for Zion's war.

2.
Rich dew of grace come o'er us,
In many a gentle show'r,
And harvest fields before us
Are op'ning ev'ry hour;
Each cry to heaven going,
Abundant answer brings,
And heav'nly gales are blowing,
With peace upon their wings.

3.
Blest river of salvation,
Pursue thy onward way;
Flow thou to ev'ry nation, 
Nor in thy richness stay.
Stay not till all the lowly
Triumphant reach their home;
Stay not till all the holy
Proclaim, "The Lord is come."
