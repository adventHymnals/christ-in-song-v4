## 718. THE WORLD IS VERY EVIL
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The world is very evil,
The times are waxing late;
Be sober and keep vigil;
The Judge is at the gate,
The Judge who comes in mercy,
The Judge who comes with might,
Who comes to end the evil,
Who comes to crown the right.

2.
Arise, arise, O Christian,
Let right to wrong succeed;
Let penitential sorrow
To heavenly gladness lead,
To light that has no evening,
That knows no moon nor sea,
The light so fair and golden,
Of Christ, the sinless One.

3.
Behold, the morn shall waken,
And shadows shall decay,
And each true-hearted servant
Shall shine as does the day;
And God, our King and Portion,
In fulnesss of his grace,
Shall we behold forever,
And worship face to face.
