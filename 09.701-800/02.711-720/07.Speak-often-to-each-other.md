        Christ in Song 717. Speak often to each other. Speak often to each other, To cheer the fainting mind; And often be your voices In pure devotion joined; Though trials may await you, The crown before you lies; Take courage, brother pilgrim, And soon you'll win the prize.

#### Advent Hymnals
## 717. SPEAK OFTEN TO EACH OTHER
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Speak often to each other,
To cheer the fainting mind;
And often be your voices
In pure devotion joined;
Though trials may await you,
The crown before you lies;
Take courage, brother pilgrim,
And soon you'll win the prize.

2.
Ye shall be mine, says Jesus,
In that auspicious day
When I make up my jewels,
Released from cumb'rous clay;
He'll polish and refine you
From worthless dross and sin,
And to his heavenly kingdom
Will bid you enter in.

3.
We'll range the wide dominion
Of our Redeemer round,
And in dissolving raptures
Be lost in love profound;
While all the flaming harpers
Begin the lasting song,
With hallelujahs rolling
From the unnumbered throng.

```
