####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
How long, O Lord our Saviour,
Wilt thou remain away?
Our hearts are growing weary
Of thy so long delay.
O when shall come the moment,
When, brighter far than morn,
The sunshine of thy glory
Shall on thy people dawn?

2.
How long, O gracious Master,
Wilt thou thy household leave?
So long hast thou now tarried,
Few thy return believe.
Immersed in sloth and folly,
Thy servants, Lord, we see;
And few of us stand ready
With joy to welcome thee.

3.
O, wake thy slumb'ring people;
Send forth the solemn cry;
Let all the saints repeat it,
"The Saviour draweth nigh!"
May all our lamps be burning,
Our loins well girded be,
Each longing heart preparing
With joy thy face to see.
