#### Advent Hymnals
## 796. GENTLY THINK AND SPEAK
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Gently think, and gently speak,
Art thou strong?  respect the weak;
Art thou weak?  from what thou art,
Gently touch another's heart.

2.
He who knew the thoughts of men,
Gentle was; O let us then
Careful be in thought and tone,
We, who scarce can read our own.

3.
Rain and dews, and sunshine fall,
With unbounded love, on all;
Shall my narrow heart refuse
Its poor sun, and rain, and dews?

4.
Then be gentle, O my soul,
Thoughts and words alike control;
If thou must in aught decide,
Err upon the gentle side.
