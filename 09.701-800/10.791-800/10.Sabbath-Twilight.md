####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Softly fades the twilight ray
Of the holy Sabbath-day,
Gently as life's setting sun
When the Christian's course is run.

2.
Peace is on the world abroad;
'Tis the holy peace of God,
Symbol of the peace within
When the spirit rests from sin.

3.
Saviour, may our Sabbaths be
Days of joy and peace in Thee,
Till in heav'n our souls repose, 
Where the Sabbath ne'er shall close.

```
