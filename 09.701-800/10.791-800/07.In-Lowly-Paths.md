## 797. IN LOWLY PATHS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O Master, let me walk with thee
In lowly paths of service free;
Tell me thy secret, help me bear
The strain of toil, the fret o care.

2.
Help me the slow of heart to move
By some clear winning word of love;
Teach me the wayward feet to stay,
And guide them in the homeward way.

3.
Teach me thy patience; still with thee
In closer, dearer company,
In work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
In trust that triumphs over wrong;

4.
In hope that sends a shining ray
Far down the future's broad'ning way;
In peace that wealth can never give,
With thee, O Master, let me live.


```
