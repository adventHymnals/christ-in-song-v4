## 794. NEW EVERY MORNING
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
New ev'ry morning is Thy love,
This our awak'ning powers prove,
Thro' sleep and darkness safely bro't
Back into life and strength and tho't.

2.
New mercies each returning day
Hover around us while we pray,
New perils past, new sins forgiv'n,
New tho'ts of God, new hopes of heav'n.

3.
O may we thankfully receive,
And rightly use what Thou dost give,
So shall new blessings still be ours,
New consecration claim our pow'rs.
