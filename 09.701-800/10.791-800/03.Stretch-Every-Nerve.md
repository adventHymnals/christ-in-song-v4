## 793. STRETCH EVERY NERVE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Awake my soul!  stretch ev'ry nerve,
And press with vigor on;
A heav'nly race demands thy zeal,
And an immortal crown.

2.
'Tis God's all animating voice,
That calls thee from on high;
'Tis he whose hand presents the prize
To thine aspiring eye.

3.
A cloud of witnesses around,
Hold thee in full survey;
Forget the steps already trod,
And onward urge thy way.

4.
Blest Saviour, introduced by thee,
Our race have we begun;
And, crown'd with vict'ry, at thy feet
We'll lay our trophies down.
