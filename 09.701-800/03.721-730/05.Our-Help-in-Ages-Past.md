## 725. OUR HELP IN AGES PAST
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O God our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come;
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home!

2.
Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure;
Sufficient in thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure.

3.
Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.

4.
A thousand ages, in Thy sight, 
Are like an ev'ning gone;
Short as the watch that ends the night,
Before the rising sun.
