1.
Saviour, like a shepherd lead us;
Much we need thy tender care;
In thy pleasant pastures feed us,
For our use thy fold prepare;
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Thou hast bought us, thine we are;
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Thou hast bought us, thine we are.

2.
We are thine, do thou befriend us,
Be the Guardian of our way;
Keep thy flock, from sin defend us,
Seek us when we go astray,
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Hear, O hear us, when we pray;
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Hear, O hear us, when we pray.

3.
Thou hast promised to receive us,
Poor and sinful tho' we be;
Thou hast mercy to relieve us,
Grace to cleanse, and pow'r to free.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
We will early turn to thee;
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
We will early turn to thee.
