## 730. GOD HAS SAID, FOREVER BLESSED 
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
God has said, "Forever blessed
Those who seek me in their youth;
Thy shall find the path of wisdom,
And the narrow way of truth."
Guide us, Saviour,
Guide us, Saviour,
In the narrow way of truth.

2.
Be our strength, for we are weakness;
Be our wisdom and our guide;
May we walk in love and meekness,
Nearer to our Saviour's side:
Naught can harm us;
Naught can harm us;
While we thus in thee abide.

```
