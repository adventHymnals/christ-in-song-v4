    1.
    Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,
    Weak and wounded, sick and sore;
    Jesus ready stands to save you,
    Full of pity, love, and pow'r.

    Chorus:
    Turn to the Lord, and seek salvation,
    Sound the praise of his dear name;
    Glory, honor, and salvation,
    Christ the Lord is come to reign.

    2.
    Now ye needy, come and welcome,
    God's free bounty glorify;
    True belief and true repentance,
    Ev'ry grace that brings you nigh.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Let not conscience make you linger,
    Nor of fitness fondly dream;
    All the fitness he requireth
    Is to feel our need of him.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Come, ye weary, heavy-laden,
    Bruised and mangled by the fall,
    If you tarry till you're better,
    You will never come at all.  [Chorus]
