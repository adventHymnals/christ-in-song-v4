    1.
    To-day the Saviour calls;
    Ye wand'rers, come;
    O ye benighted souls,
    Why longer roam?

    2.
    To-day the Saviour calls;
    Oh, hear him now;
    Within these sacred walls
    To Jesus bow.

    3.
    To-day the Saviour calls;
    For refuge fly;
    The storm of justice falls,
    And death is nigh.

    4.
    The Spirit calls to-day;
    Yield to his pow'r,
    Oh, grieve him not away,
    'Tis mercy's hour.
