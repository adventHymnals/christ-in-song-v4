    1.
    When I survey the wondrous cross
    On which the prince of glory died,
    My richest gain I count but loss,
    And pour contempt on all my pride.

    2.
    See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
    Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
    Did e'er such love and sorrow meet?
    Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

    3.
    Since I, who was undone and lost,
    Have pardon thro' his name and word;
    Forbid it, then, that I should boast,
    Save in the cross of Christ, my Lord.

    4.
    Were the whole realm of nature mine,
    That were a tribute far too small;
    Love so amazing, so divine,
    Demands my life, my soul, my all.
