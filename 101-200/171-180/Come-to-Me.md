[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kk_Y5civezc0LntrYrJ_riyrDU%2DHIopY/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    With tearful eyes I look around;
    Life seems a dark and stormy sea,
    Yet, mid the gloom, I hear a sound,
    A heavenly whisper, "Come to me."

    2.
    It tells me of a place of rest;
    It tells me where my soul may flee:
    O, to the weary, faint, oppressed,
    How sweet the bidding, "Come to me.

    3.
    "Come, for all else must fail and die!
    Earth is no resting place for thee;
    To heav'n direct thy weeping eye,
    I am thy portion; come to me."

    4.
    O voice of mercy!  voice of love!
    In conflict, grief, and agony,
    Support me, cheer me from above!
    And gently whisper, "Come to me."
