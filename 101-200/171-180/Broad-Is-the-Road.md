## 177.  Broad Is the Road

    1.
    Broad is the road that leads to death,
    And thousands walk together there;
    But wisdom shows a narrow path,
    With here and there a traveler.

    2.
    Deny thyself, and take thy cross,
    Is thy Redeemer's great command;
    Nature must count her gold but dross,
    If she would gain that heav'nly land.

    3.
    The fearful soul that tires and faints,
    And walks the ways of God no more;
    Is but esteem'd almost a saint,
    And makes his own destruction sure.
