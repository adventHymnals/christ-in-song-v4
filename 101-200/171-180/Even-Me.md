[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K8GPeq3l1Kd9YTUtm60s0eTLJq1o2tCp/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Lord, I hear of show'rs of blessing
    Thou art scatt'ring full and free;
    Show'rs the thirsty soul refreshing;
    Let some drops now fall on me;

    Refrain:
    Even me, even me,
    Let some drops now fall on me.

    2.
    Pass me not, O gracious Father!
    Sinful though my heart may be;
    Thou might'st leave me, but the rather
    Let thy mercy rest on me.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Have I long in sin been sleeping?
    Long been slighting, grieving thee?
    Has the world my heart been keeping?
    O forgive and rescue me!  [Refrain]

    4.
    Pass me not, O holy Spirit!
    Thou canst make the blind to see;
    Testify of Jesus' merit,
    Speak the word of peace to me.  [Refrain]
