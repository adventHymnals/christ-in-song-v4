[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KH6280a8pwoLEhOia45T%2Dhe92LNy5By0/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    One there is above all others,
    Well deserves the name of Friend;
    His is love beyond a brother's,
    Costly, free, and knows no end.

    2.
    Which of all our friends, to save us,
    Could or would have shed his blood?
    But our Jesus died to have us
    Reconciled in him to God.

    3.
    O for grace our hearts to soften!
    Teach us, Lord, to truly love;
    We, alas!  forget too often
    What a Friend we have above.
