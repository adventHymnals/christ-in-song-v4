    1.
    Be silent, be silent,
    A whisper is heard,
    Be silent, and listen,
    Oh, treasure each word.

    Chorus:
    Tread softly, tread softly,
    The Master is here;
    Tread softly, tread softly,
    He bids us draw near.

    2.
    Be silent, be silent,
    For holy this place,
    This altar that echoes
    The message of grace.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Be silent, be silent,
    Breathe humbly our pray'r,
    A foretaste of Eden
    This moment we share.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Be silent, be silent,
    His mercy record;
    Be silent, be silent,
    And wait on the Lord.  [Chorus]
