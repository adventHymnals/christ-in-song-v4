    1.
    I can hear my Saviour calling,
    In the tend'rest accents calling;
    On my ear these words are falling,
    Come and follow, daily follow me."

    Chorus:
    I will take my cross and follow.
    My dear Saviour I will follow;
    Where he leads me I will follow,
    I'll go with him, with all the way.

    2.
    Tho' the way be dark and dreary,
    Tho' my feet be worn and weary,
    Yet my heart keeps bright and cheery
    As I follow, follow all the way.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Jesus, ever go before me,
    Shining heaven's sunlight o'er me,
    And when weak, by grace restore me
    As I follow, follow all the way.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Thro' the valley safely lead me,
    Heav'nly manna daily feed me;
    Ev'ry hour, dear Lord, I need thee
    As I follow, follow all the way.  [Chorus]

    5.
    In thy heart's affection, hold me,
    In thy arms of love enfold me,
    And with thine own grace uphold me,
    As I follow, follow all the way.  [Chorus]
