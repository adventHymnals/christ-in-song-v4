    1.
    Would we be joyful in the Lord?
    Then count the riches o'er,
    Revealed to faith within His Word,
    And note the boundless store.

    Chorus:
    There is pardon, peace and pow'r,
    And purity, and Paradise;
    With all of these in Christ for me,
    Let joyful songs of praise to Him arise.

    2.
    For ev'ry sin, by grace divine
    A pardon free bestowed;
    And with the pardon peace is mine,
    The peace in Jesus' blood.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Of grace to break the pow'r of sin,
    He gives a full supply;
    The Holy Ghost, the heart within,
    From sin doth purify.  [Chorus]

    4.
    The pow'r to win a soul to God,
    The Spirit, too, imparts;
    And He, the gift of Christ, our Lord,
    Dwells now in all our hearts.  [Chorus]

    5.
    These blessings we by faith receive,
    By simple childlike trust;
    In Christ 'tis God's delight to give;
    He promised, and He must.  [Chorus]
