    1.
    O, spread the tidings round,
    Wherever man is found,
    Wherever human hearts 
    And human woes abound;
    Let ev'ry Christian tongue
    Proclaim the joyful sound:
    The Comforter has come.

    Chorus:  
    The Comforter has come,
    The Comforter has come!
    The Holy Ghost from heav'n,
    The Father's promise giv'n;
    O, spread the tidings round,
    Wherever man is found,
    The Comforter has come!

    2.
    The long, long night is past,
    The morning breaks at last;
    And hush'd the dreadful wail
    And fury of the blast,
    As o'er the golden hills
    The day advances fast:
    The Comforter has come!  [Chorus]

    3.
    Behold, the King of kings,
    With healing in his wings,
    To ev'ry captive soul
    A full deliv'rance brings;
    And thro' the vacant cells
    The song of triumph rings:
    The Comforter has come!  [Chorus]

    4.
    O boundless Love divine!
    How shall this tongue of mine
    To wond'ring mortals tell
    The matchless grace divine,
    That I, a child of sin,
    Should in his image shine!  
    The Comforter has come!  [Chorus]

    5.
    Sing, till the echoes fly
    Above the vaulted sky,
    And all the saints above
    To all below reply,
    In strains of endless love,
    The song that ne'er will die:
    The Comforter has come!  [Chorus]
