    1.
    Redeemed!  how I love to proclaim it!
    Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
    Redeemed thro' his infinite mercy,
    His child, and forever, I am.  

    Refrain:
    Redeemed, redeemed,
    Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
    Redeemed, redeemed,
    His child, and forever, I am.

    2.
    Redeemed!  and so happy in Jesus!
    No language my rapture can tell;
    I know that the light of his presence
    With me doth continually dwell.  [Refrain]

    3.
    I think of my blessed Redeemer,
    I think of him all the day long;
    I sing; for I cannot be silent;
    His love is the theme of my song.  [Refrain]

    4.
    I know I shall see in his beauty
    The King in whose law I delight,
    Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
    And giveth me songs in the night.  [Refrain]

    5.
    I know there's a crown that is waiting
    In yonder bright mansion for me;
    And soon, with the spirits made perfect,
    At home with the Lord I shall be.  [Refrain]
