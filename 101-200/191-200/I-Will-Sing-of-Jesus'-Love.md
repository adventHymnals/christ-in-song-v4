    1.
    I will sing of Jesus' love,
    Sing of him who first loved me;
    For he left bright worlds above,
    And died on Calvary.

    Refrain:
    I will sing of Jesus' love,
    Endless praise my heart shall give;
    He has died that I might live,
    I will sing his love to me

    2.
    Ere a tear had dim'd mine eyes,
    Jesus' tears for me did flow;
    Ere my first faint prayer could rise,
    He had prayed in tones of woe.  [Refrain]

    3.
    O the depths of love divine!
    Earth or heav'n can never know
    How that sins as dark as mine
    Can be made as white as snow.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Nothing good for him I've done;
    How could he such love bestow?
    Lord, I own my heart is won;
    Help me now my love to show.  [Refrain]
