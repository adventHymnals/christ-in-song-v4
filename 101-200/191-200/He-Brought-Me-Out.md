    1.
    My heart was distress'd neath Jehovah's dread frown,
    And low in the pit where my sins dragg'd me down;
    I cried to the Lord from the deep miry clay,
    Who tenderly brought me out to golden day.

    Chorus:
    He brought me out of the miry clay,
    He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
    He puts a song in my soul to-day,
    A song of praise, hallelujah!

    2.
    He placed me upon the strong Rock by His side,
    My steps were established and here I'll abide;
    No danger of falling while here I remain,
    But stand by His grace until the crown I gain.  [Chorus]

    3.
    He gave me a song, 'twas a new song of praise.
    By day and by night its sweet notes I will raise;
    My heart's overflowing, I'm happy and free,
    I'll praise my Redeemer, who has rescued me.  [Chorus]

    4.
    I'll sing of His wonderful mercy to me,
    I'll praise Him till all men His goodness shall see;
    I'll sing of salvation at home and abroad,
    Till many shall hear the truth and trust in God.  [Chorus]
