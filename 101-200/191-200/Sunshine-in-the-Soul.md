    1.
    There's sunshine in my soul to-day,
    More glorious and bright
    Than glows in any earthly sky,
    For Jesus is my light.

    Chorus:
    O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,
    When the peaceful, happy moments roll;
    When Jesus shows his smiling face
    There is sunshine in the soul.

    2.
    There's music in my soul to-day,
    A carol to my King,
    And Jesus listening, can hear
    The songs I cannot sing.  [Chorus]

    3.
    There's springtime in my soul to-day,
    For when the Lord is near,
    The dove of peace sings in my heart,
    The flow'rs of grace appear.  [Chorus]

    4.
    There's gladness in my soul to-day,
    And hope, and praise, and love,
    For blessings which he gives me now,
    For joys laid up above.  [Chorus]
