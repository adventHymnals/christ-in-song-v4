    1.
    Father, I stretch my hands to thee;
    No other help I know;
    If thou withdraw thyself from me,
    Ah, whither shall I go?

    2.
    On thy dear Son I now believe,
    O let me feel thy pow'r;
    And all my varied wants relieve,
    In this accepted hour.

    3.
    Author of faith!  to thee I lift
    My weary, longing eyes:
    O let me now receive that gift;
    My soul without it dies.
