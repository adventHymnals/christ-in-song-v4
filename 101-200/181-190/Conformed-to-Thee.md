[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L_Nhso9iIWljCd1wgKoPeeE%2DHBlMZSJn/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    When, my Saviour, shall I be
    Perfectly conformed to thee?
    Poor and vile in my own eyes,
    Only in thy wisdom wise;

    2.
    Only thee content to know,
    Ignorant of all below;
    Only guided by thy light,
    Only mighty in thy might?

    3.
    Fully in my life express
    All the hights of holiness;
    Sweetly let my spirit prove
    All the depths of humble love.
