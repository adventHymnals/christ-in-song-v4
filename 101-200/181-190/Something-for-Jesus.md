    1.
    They bro't their gifts to Jesus,
    And laid them at his feet,
    And love for this dear Saviour,
    Made ev'ry off'ring sweet;
    Good deeds and words of kindness,
    Help for the poor of earth,
    And not a gift among them
    Was tho't of little worth.

    Chorus:
    Wouldst bring a gift to Jesus,
    That he will count most sweet?
    Say, "Lord, my heart I give thee,"
    And lay it at his feet.

    2.
    Apart from other givers
    A poor wayfarer stood;
    He saw the gifts they offered,
    The poorest counted good,
    And he was filled with longing,
    A gift, tho' poor, to bring;
    Alas!  all empty handed 
    He stood before the King.  [Chorus]

    3.
    "Dear Lord," he cried in sorrow,
    "I know how kind thou art,
    Take all I have to give thee,
    My sinful, wayward heart."
    Then Jesus answered softly,
    "Count not the gift as small,
    Tho' all of them are precious,
    Thine is the best of all.  [Chorus]
