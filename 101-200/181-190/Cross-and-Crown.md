[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lh55l0AsGMoQWy4nFNcpmQpHEwvrOzxC/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
    And all the world go free?
    No, there's a cross for ev'ry one,
    And there's a cross for me.

    2.
    The consecrated cross 'll bear,
    Till He shall set me free;
    And then go home my crown to wear,
    For there's a crown for me.

    3.
    Upon the crystal pavement, down
    At Jesus' pierced feet,
    With joy I'll cast my golden crown,
    And his dear name repeat.
