    1.
    God shall be first in ev'rything;
    No other gods before him;
    Creator and Redeemer King,
    'Tis pleasure to adore him.

    2.
    First when with rosy morn I wake,
    His pow'r mine eyes unsealing;
    First when his bounteous gifts I take,
    His Father love revealing.

    3.
    First when the crowding cares of day
    Impatient press upon me;
    First when the gentle twilight ray
    With peaceful calm falls on me.

    4.
    First when I leave mortality,
    The glad new song upraising;
    First all Eternity, where we
    Shall dwell who here are praising.
