    1.
    See, Israel's gentle shepherd stands,
    With all-engaging charms;
    Hark, how He calls the tender lambs.
    And folds them in His arms!

    2.
    "Permit them to approach," He cries,
    "Nor scorn their humble name;
    For 'twas to bless such souls as these,
    The Lord of angels came."

    3.
    We bring them, Lord, in thankful hands,
    And yield them up to Thee;
    Joyful that we ourselves are Thine,
    Thine let our offspring be.
