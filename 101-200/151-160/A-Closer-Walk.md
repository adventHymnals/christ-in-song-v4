    1.
    O, for a closer walk with God!
    A calm and heav'nly frame,
    A light to shine upon the road
    That leads me to the Lamb.

    2.
    Return, O holy Dove!  return,
    Sweet Messenger of rest;
    I hate the sins that made thee mourn,
    And drove thee from my breast.

    3.
    What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!  
    How sweet their mem'ry still!
    But they have left an aching void
    The world can never fill.

    4.
    The dearest idol I have known,
    Whate'er that idol be,
    Help me to tear it from thy throne,
    And worship only thee.
