    1.
    'Tis midnight; and on Olives' brow
    The star is dimmed that lately shone;
    'Tis midnight; in the garden now
    The suff'ring Saviour prays alone.

    2.
    'Tis midnight; and from all removed,
    The Saviour wrestles lone with fears;
    E'en that disciple whom he loved
    Heeds not his Master's grief and tears.

    3.
    'Tis midnight; and for others' guilt
    The Man of sorrows weeps in blood;
    Yet he who hath in anguish knelt,
    Is not forsaken by his God.

    4.
    'Tis midnight; and from other plains
    Is borne the song that angels know;
    Unheard by mortals are the strains
    That sweetly soothe the Saviour's woe.
