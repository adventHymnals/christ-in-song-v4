    1.
    Come, my soul, thy suit prepare!
    Jesus loves to answer pray'r;
    He himself has bid thee pray,
    Therefore will not say thee nay.

    2.
    With my burden I begin!
    Lord, remove this load of sin;
    Let thy blood, for sinners spilt,
    Set my conscience free from guilt.

    3.
    Lord, I come to thee for rest,
    Take possession of my breast;
    There, thy sovereign right maintain,
    And without a rival reign.
