    1.
    The day of wrath, that dreadful day,
    When heav'n and earth shall pass away!
    What pow'r shall be the sinner's stay?
    How shall he meet that dreadful day?

    2.
    When shriv'ling like a parched scroll,
    The flaming heav'ns together roll,
    And louder yet, and yet more dread,
    Resounds the trump that wakes the dead,

    3.
    On that great day, that wrathful day,
    When man to Judgment wakes from clay,
    Be thou, O Christ, thy people's stay,
    Tho' heav'n and earth shall pass away.
