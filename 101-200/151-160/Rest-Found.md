    1.
    O where shall rest be found
    Rest for the weary soul?
    'Twere vain the ocean's depths to sound,
    Or pierce to either pole.

    2.
    Beyond this vale of tears
    There is a life above,
    Unmeasured by the flight of years;
    And all that life is love.

    3.
    Thro' Christ, the Life, the Way,
    May we that life obtain;
    And thro' the merits of his blood,
    That endless glory gain.
