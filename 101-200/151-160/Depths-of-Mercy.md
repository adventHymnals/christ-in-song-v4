[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FpBJ6IhmxcIAe3Berqx3n_gKLm7AraGI/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Depth of mercy!  can there be
    Mercy still reserved for me?
    Can my God his wrath forbear?
    Me, the chief of sinners, spare?

    2.
    I have long withstood his grace,
    Long provoked him to his face,
    Would not hearken to his calls,
    Griev'd him by a thousand falls.

    3.
    There for me the Saviour stands,
    Shows his wounds and spreads his hands;
    God is love!  I know, I feel;
    Jesus weeps, and loves me still.
