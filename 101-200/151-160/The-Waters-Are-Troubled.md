    1.
    The waters are troubled,
    The angel is here;
    The fountain of mercy
    Flows healing and clear:
    O come in your sorrow,
    And come in your sin;
    The waters are troubled:
    Step in, O step in!

    2.
    The waters are troubled,
    No longer delay;
    The fountain of mercy
    Has healing today;
    Then why will you linger,
    Since lift you may win?
    The waters are troubled:
    Step in, O step in!

    3.
    The waters are troubled
    The angel still waits;
    He pauses in peril
    Who halts and debates,
    Give over your falt'ring,
    Your struggles within;
    The waters are troubled:
    Step in, O step in!
