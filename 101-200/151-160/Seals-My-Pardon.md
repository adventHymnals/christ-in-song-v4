    1.
    I saw One hanging on the tree,
    In agony and blood,
    Who fixed His languid eyes on me,
    As near His cross I stood.

    2.
    O, never till my latest breath
    Can I forget that look;
    It seemed to charge me with His death,
    Tho' not a word He spoke.

    3.
    A second look He gave, which said, 
    "I freely all forgive;
    This blood is for thy ransom paid,
    I die that thou may'st live."

    4.
    Thus while His death my sin displays
    In all its blackest hue,
    Such is the mystery of grace,
    It seals my pardon too.
