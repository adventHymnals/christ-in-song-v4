    1.
    Baptize us anew
    With pow'r from on high,
    With love, O refresh us!
    Dear Saviour, draw nigh.

    Chorus:
    We humbly beseech thee, Lord, Jesus, we pray,
    With love and the Spirit baptize us to-day.

    2.
    Unworthy we cry,
    Unholy, unclean, 
    O wash us and cleanse us
    From sin's guilty stain.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O heavenly dove,
    Descend from on high!
    We plead thy rich blessing;
    In mercy draw nigh.  [Chorus]

    4.
    O list the glad voice!
    From heaven it came:
    Thou art my beloved,
    Well pleased I am.

    Chorus:
    We praise thee, we bless the, dear Lamb that was slain
    We land and adore thee, Amen and Amen.
