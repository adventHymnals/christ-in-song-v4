[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IX1lD4VZX%2DKwRnKGQ8Uf2guit6JtmBg_/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O that the Lord would guide my ways
    To keep his statutes still!
    O that my God would grant me grace
    To know and do his will!

    2.
    O send thy Spirit down to write
    Thy law upon my heart,
    Nor let my tongue indulge deceit,
    Nor act the liar's part.

    3.
    From vanity turn off my eyes,
    Let no corrupt design
    Nor covetous desires arise
    Within this soul of mine.

    4.
    Order my footsteps by thy word,
    And make my heart sincere;
    Let sin have no dominion, Lord,
    But keep my conscience clear.
