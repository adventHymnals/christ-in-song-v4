    1.
    Chief of sinners tho' I be,
    Jesus shed his blood for me,
    Died that I might live on high,
    Died that I might never die;
    As the branch is to the vine,
    I am his, and he is mine.

    2.
    O the height of Jesus' love!
    Higher than the heav'n above,
    Deeper than the deepest sea,
    Lasting as eternity;
    Love that found me wondrous tho't!
    Found me when I sought him not.

    3.
    Chief of sinners tho' I be,
    Christ is all in all to me;
    All my wants to him are known,
    All my sorrows are his own;
    Safe with him from earthly strife,
    He sustains the hidden life.
