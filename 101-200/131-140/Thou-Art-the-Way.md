    1.
    Thou art the Way, to thee alone,
    From sin and death we flee;
    And he who would the Father seek,
    Must seek him, Lord, by thee.

    2.
    Thou art the Truth; thy word alone,
    True wisdom can impart;
    Thou only canst inform the mind,
    And purify the heart.

    3.
    Thou art the Life; the rending tomb
    Proclaims thy conq'ring arm;
    And those who put their trust in thee,
    Nor death nor hell shall harm.

    4.
    Thou art the Way, the Truth, the life;
    Grant us that way to know,
    That truth to keep, that life to win,
    Whose joys eternal flow.
