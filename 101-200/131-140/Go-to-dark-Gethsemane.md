    1.
    Go to dark Gethsemane,
    Ye that feel the tempter's power;
    Your Redeemer's conflict see,
    Watch with him one bitter hour;
    Turn not from his griefs away,
    Learn of Jesus how to pray.

    2.
    Follow to the judgment-hall;
    View the Lord of life arraigned;
    See the wormwood and the gall;
    See the pangs his soul sustained;
    Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;
    Learn of him to bear the cross.

    3.
    Calvary's mournful mountain climb;
    There, adoring at his feet,
    Mark that miracle of time,
    God's own sacrifice complete:
    "It is finished!" hear him cry;
    Learn of Jesus how to die.
