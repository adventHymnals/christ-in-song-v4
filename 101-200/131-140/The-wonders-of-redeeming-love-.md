    1.
    The wonders of redeeming love
    Our highest thoughts exceed;
    The Son of God comes from above,
    For sinful man to bleed.

    2.
    He gives himself, his life, his all,
    A sinless sacrifice,
    For man he drains the cup of gall,
    For man the Maker dies.

    3.
    And now before his Father's face
    His precious blood he pleads;
    For those who seek the throne of grace
    His love still intercedes.
