[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ID4YWfs5fgm7QMcD1oxrLlssSYEDZEyR/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The last call of mercy now lingers for thee;
    O sinner, receive it; to Jesus now flee!
    He often has called thee, but thou hast refused;
    His offered salvation and love are abused.

    2.
    O slight not the warning now offered at last,
    Till summer is ended and harvest is past;
    Till mercy, long slighted, has left thy heart's door,
    And pardon, sweet pardon is offered no more.

    3.
    While Jesus is calling, O turn not away;
    For swiftly approaches the dread Judgment day:
    The Spirit invites you, O why will you roam?
    Come now to life's waters, ye thirsty ones, come.
