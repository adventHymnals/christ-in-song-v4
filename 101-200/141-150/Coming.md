    1.
    He's coming once again,
    To set his people free;
    That where he is, in glory bright,
    His saints may also be.
    Then lift the drooping head.
    Look up, rejoice and sing;
    He comes in majesty sublime,
    Salvation's glorious King!

    2.
    The earth shall quake with fear,
    The heav'ns shall flee away;
    And where shall guilty man appear
    In that tremendous day?
    No refuge then is night,
    No shelter from the blast;
    The night of vengeance vails the sky
    When mercy's day is past.

    3.
    His eyes of living flame,
    The wicked shall devour;
    No tongue will lightly speak the name
    Of Jesus in that hour.
    No scorn, no words of hate,
    For his meek foll'wers then;
    But prayers and tears that come too late,
    Will mark earth's mighty men.
