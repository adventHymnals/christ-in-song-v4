[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jl1QG4wQ326UOS%2D3z0Q8YiodyQWz_drQ/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I bring my sins to Thee,
    The sins I cannot count,
    That all may cleansed be,
    In thy once opened Fount; 
    I bring them, Saviour, all to thee;
    The burden is too great for me.

    2.
    I bring my grief to Thee,
    The grief I cannot tell;
    No words shall needed be,
    Thou knowest all so well:
    I bring the sorrow laid on me,
    O suff'ring Saviour!  all to thee.

    3.
    My heart to thee I bring,
    The heart I cannot read,
    A faithless, wand'ring thing,
    An evil heart indeed:
    I bring it, Saviour, now to thee,
    That fix'd and faithful it may be.

    4.
    My life I bring to thee,
    I would not be my own;
    O Saviour let me be Thine, ever thine alone
    My heart, my life, my all, I bring
    To thee, my Saviour and my King.
