[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JxUYEpAKzRTse3TEK8YhaWVt5UFbN0Wq/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Just as I am, without one plea
    But that thy blood was shed for me,
    And that thou bid'st me come to thee,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    2.
    Just as I am, and waiting not
    To rid my soul of one dark blot,
    To thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    3.
    Just as I am, though tossed about
    With many' a conflict, many' a doubt
    "Fightings within, and fears without,"
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    4.
    Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind,
    Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
    Yea, all I need, in thee to find,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    5.
    Just as I am, thou wilt receive,
    Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
    Because thy promise I believe,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

    6.
    Just as I am, thy love I own
    Has broken ev'ry barrier down;
    Now to be thine, and thine alone,
    O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
