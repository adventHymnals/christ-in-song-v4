    1.
    There is a fountain fill'd with blood,
    Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
    And sinners plung'd beneath that flood
    Lose all their guilty stains.
    Lose all their guilty stains,
    Lose all their guilty stains,
    And sinners plung'd beneath that flood
    Lose all their guilty stains.

    2.
    The dying thief rejoiced to see,
    That fountain in his day;
    And there may I, though vile as he,
    Wash all my sins away.
    Wash all my sins away,
    Wash all my sins away,
    And there may I, though vile as he,
    Wash all my sins away.

    3.
    Thou dying Lamb!  thy precious blood
    Shall never lose its pow'r,
    Till all the ransomed Church of God
    Are saved to sin no more.
    Are saved to sin no more,
    Are saved to sin no more.
    Till all the ransomed Church of God
    Are saved to sin no more.

    4.
    E'er since by faith I saw the stream
    Thy flowing wounds supply,
    Redeeming love has been my theme,
    And shall be till I die.

    5.
    Lord, I believe thou hast prepared,
    Unworthy though I be,
    For me a blood-bought, free reward
    Eternal life for me.

    6.
    There in a nobler, sweeter song,
    I'll sing thy pow'r to save,
    When this poor lisping, stam'ring tongue
    Is ransom'd from the grave.
