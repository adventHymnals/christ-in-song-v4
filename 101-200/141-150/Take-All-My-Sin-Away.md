    1.
    O spotless Lamb!  I come to thee,
    No longer can I from thee stay;
    Break ev'ry chain, now set me free,
    Take all my sin away.

    Chorus:
    Take all my sin away,
    Take all my sin away;
    O spotless Lamb, I come to thee;    
    Take all my sin away.

    2.
    Weary I am of inbred sin,
    Oh, wilt thou not my soul release?
    Enter and speak me pure within,
    Give me thy perfect peace.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I plunge beneath thy precious blood,
    My hand in faith takes hold of thee;
    Thy promises just now I claim;
    Thou art enough for me.   

    Chorus:
    Take all my sin away,
    Take all my sin away;
    O spotless Lamb, I come to thee;
    He takes my sin away.
