    1.
    Return, O wanderer, return,
    And seek thy Father's face;
    Those new desires which in thee burn,
    Were kindled by his grace.

    2.
    Return, O wanderer, return;
    Thy Saviour bids thee live;
    Come to his cross, and, grateful, learn
    How freely he'll forgive.

    3.
    Return, O wanderer, return,
    And wipe the falling tear;
    Thy Father calls no longer mourn;
    'Tis love invites thee near.
