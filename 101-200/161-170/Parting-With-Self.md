    1.
    And must I part with all of self,
    My dearest Lord, for thee?
    It is but right since thou hast done
    Much more than this for me.

    2.
    Yes, let it go; one look from thee
    Will more than make amends
    For all the losses I sustain
    Of honor, riches, friends.

    3.
    Ten thousand worlds, ten thousand lives,
    How worthless they appear
    Compared with thee, supremely good,
    Divinely bright and fair!
