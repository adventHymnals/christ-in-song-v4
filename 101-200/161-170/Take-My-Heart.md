[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nahvv4SZbKVfPi%2D5j8ZFzo9pkQCdIYVh/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Take my heart, O Father, take it!
    Make and keep it all Thine own;
    Let Thy Spirit melt and break it,
    This proud heart of sin and stone.

    2.
    Father, make it pure and lowly,
    Fond of peace and far from strife;
    Turning from the paths unholy,
    Of this vain and sinful life.

    3.
    Ever let Thy race surround me,
    Strengthen me with pow'r divine;
    By Thy cords of love that bound me,
    Make me to be wholly Thine.

    4.
    May the blood of Jesus heal me,
    And my sins be all forgiv'n;
    Holy Spirit, take and seal me, 
    Guide me in the path to heav'n.
