    1.
    Come to the living waters, come!
    Obey your Maker's call;
    Return, ye weary wand'rers, home;
    My grace is free for all,
    My grace is free for all.

    2.
    Nothing ye in exchange shall give;
    Leave all you have behind;
    Freely the gift of God receive,
    And peace in Jesus find,
    And peace in Jesus find.

    3.
    I bid you all my goodness prove;
    My promises are free:
    Come, taste the manna of my love,
    Delight your souls in me,
    Delight your souls in me.
