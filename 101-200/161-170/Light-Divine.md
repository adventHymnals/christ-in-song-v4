    1.
    Holy Spirit, light divine,
    Shine upon this heart of mine,
    Chase the shades of night away,
    Turn my darkness into day.

    2.
    Holy Spirit, pow'r divine,
    Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
    Long has sin, without control,
    Held dominion o'er my soul.

    3.
    Holy Spirit, all divine,
    Dwell within this heart of mine,
    Cast down ev'ry idol throne,
    Reign supreme, and reign alone.
