    1.
    Come, gracious Spirit, heavenly Dove,
    With light and comfort from above;
    Be thou our Guardian, thou our Guide;
    O'er all our thoughts and steps preside.

    2.
    To us the light of truth display,
    And make us know and choose thy way;
    Plant holy fear in ev'ry heart,
    That we from God may ne'er depart.

    3.
    Lead us to holiness, the road
    That we must take to dwell with God:
    Lead us to Christ, the living way,
    Nor let us from his precepts stray.

    4.
    Lead us to God, our final rest,
    To be with Him forever blest;
    Lead us to heav'n, its bliss to share
    Fulness of joy forever there!
