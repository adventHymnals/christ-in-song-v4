    1.
    The Lord first empties whom he fills,
    Casts down whom he would raise;
    He quickens when the letter kills,
    Exalting thus his praise.
    When he applies his healing blood
    Unto a sin-sick soul,
    This balsam, pow'rful, precious, good,
    Ne'er fails to make it whole.

    2.
    On us he spent his life and blood,
    Our losses to retrieve;
    Mankind's redemption now holds good
    For sinners who believe.
    Lord, I believe!  whate'er befall,
    A thankful heart be mine,
    A heart that answers to thy call,
    One that is wholly thine.
