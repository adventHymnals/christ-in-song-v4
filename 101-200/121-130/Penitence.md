    1.
    Jesus, let thy pitying eye
    Call back a wand'ring sheep;
    False to thee, like Peter, I
    Would fain like Peter, weep.
    Speak the reconciling word,
    And let thy mercy melt me down;
    Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
    And break my heart of stone.

    2.
    Saviour, Prince, enthroned above,
    Repentance to impart,
    Give me, thro' thy dying love,
    The humble, contrite heart;
    Give what I have long implor'd,
    A portion of thy grief unknown;
    Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
    And break my heart of stone.

    3.
    For thine own compassion's sake,
    The gracious wonder show;
    Cast my sins behind thy back,
    And wash me white as snow:
    If thy pity now is stirr'd,
    If now I do myself bemoan,
    Turn, and look upon me, Lord,
    And break my heart of stone.

    4.
    Clothe me with thy holiness,
    Thy meek humility;
    Put on me thy glorious dress
    Endue my soul with thee:
    Let thine image be restor'd,
    Thy name and nature let me prove;
    Fill me with thy fulness, Lord,
    And perfect me in love.
