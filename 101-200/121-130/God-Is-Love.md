[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MoHj64rx6HFj0yGiocjtI%2DrOc6jejPFD/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God is love; His mercy brightens
    All the path in which we rove;
    Bliss He wakes, and woe He lightens:
    God is wisdom, God is love.

    2.
    Chance and change are busy ever;
    Man decays and ages move;
    But His mercy waneth never:
    God is wisdom, God is love.

    3.
    E'en the hour that darkest seemeth
    Will His changeless goodness prove;
    From the gloom His brightness streameth:
    God is wisdom, God is love.

    4.
    He with earthly cares entwineth
    Hope and comfort from above;
    Everywhere His glory shineth;
    God is wisdom, God is love.
