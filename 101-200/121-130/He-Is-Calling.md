[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NFnUJrmmUEGqnCB5nwalWfUPn9%2DK4UB2/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There's a wideness in God's mercy,
    Like the wideness of the sea;
    There's a kindness in his justice,
    Which is more than liberty.

    Refrain:
    He is calling, "Come to me;" 
    Lord, I gladly follow thee!

    2.
    There is welcome for the sinner,
    And more graces for the good;
    There is mercy with the Saviour;
    There is healing in his blood.  [Refrain]

    3.
    There's no place where earthly sorrows
    Are more felt than up in heav'n;
    There's no place where earthly failings
    Have such kindly judgment giv'n.  [Refrain]

    4.
    For the love of God is broader
    Than the measure of man's mind;
    And the heart of the Eternal
    Is most wonderfully kind.  [Refrain]

    5.
    But we make his love too narrow,
    By false limits of our own;
    And we magnify his strictness
    With a zeal he will not own.  [Refrain]

    6.
    If our love were but more simple,
    We should take him at his word;
    And our lives would be all sunshine
    In the sweetness of our Lord.  [Refrain]
