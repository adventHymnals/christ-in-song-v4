[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N8o4xr2tyqDMowPKz25UegxBfv7lY86u/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Weary of earth and laden with my sin,
    I look to heav'n and long to enter in;
    But there no evil thing may find a home:
    And yet I hear a voice that bids me "Come."

    2.
    The while I fain would tread the heav'nly way,
    Evil is ever with me day by day;
    Yet on mine ears the gracious tidings fall,
    "Repent, return, thou shalt be loos'd from all."

    3.
    Cease, restless will!  thy lonely strife resign!
    I know too well how little strength is mine;
    Grant me, dear Lord, thy saving love to see:
    I strive no more, I give myself to thee.
