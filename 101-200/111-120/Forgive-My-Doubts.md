[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FSH416RgN%2DrQ21qgxNNkkgV1nFDd7lGS/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Forgive, O Lord, the doubts that break
    Thy promises to me;
    Forgive me that I fail to take 
    My pardon, full and free.
    I sought to put my sins away,
    I strove to do Thy will,
    And yet, whene'er I tried to pray,
    My heart was doubting still.

    2.
    I tho't that Thou with jealous eyes
    Wast watching me alway,
    My deeds to mark, my steps to spy,
    Whene'er I went astray;
    I hoped that when, by days and years
    Of service and of prayer,
    I had besought Thy grace with tears,
    Thy mercy I might share.

    3.
    Forgive, O Father, this my sin,
    This jealous, doubting heart;
    For when men seek Thy love to win,
    And choose the better part,
    I know that, swifter than the light
    Leaps earthward from the sun,
    Thy pard'ning love,
    Thy rescuing might,
    Speed down to ev'ry one.
