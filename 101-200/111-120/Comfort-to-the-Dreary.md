    1.
    O, Comfort to the dreary!
    O, Joy to the oppressed!
    "Come unto Me, ye weary,
    And I will give you rest."
    O, come with all your weakness,
    Come with your load of woe;
    And learn if him with meekness
    All righteousness to know.

    3.
    Ye who the world have courted,
    And suffer'd from its spite;
    Ye who with sin have sported,
    And felt its serpent bite;
    Come, learn, your follies quitting,
    That this world's gain is loss;
    To Christ's light yoke submitting,
    Come, and take up the cross. 

    4.
    O come and make the trial;
    Christ's service is release;
    If hard the self denial,
    Its fruit is joy and peace.
    His word your faith defending,
    Shall serve you for the strife;
    Peace all your steps attending;
    The prime, eternal life!
