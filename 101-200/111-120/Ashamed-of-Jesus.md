    1.
    Jesus, and shall it ever be,
    A mortal man ashamed of thee?
    Ashamed of thee, whom angels praise,
    Whose glories shine through endless days?

    2.
    Ashamed of Jesus!  sooner far
    Let evening blush to own a star;
    He sheds the beams of light divine
    O'er this benighted soul of mine.

    3.
    Ashamed of Jesus! just as soon
    Let midnight be ashamed of noon;
    'Twas midnight with my soul till he,
    Bright Morning Star, bade darkness flee.

    4.
    Ashamed of Jesus!  that dear Friend
    On whom my hopes of heav'n depend!
    No; when I blush, be this my shame,
    That I no more revere his name.

    5.
    Ashamed of Jesus!  yes, I may 
    When I've no guilt to wash away;
    No tear to wipe, no good to crave,
    No fears to quell, no soul to save.

    6.
    Till then, nor is my boasting vain,
    Till then I boast a Saivour slain;
    And O, may this my glory be,
    That Christ is not ashamed of me!
