[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FWe3Wx_wKY2sdGqCLDGpThgrzvl5RyRO/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God calling yet!  shall I not hear?
    Earth's pleasures shall I still hold dear?
    Shall life's swift passing years all fly,
    And still my soul in slumber lie?

    2.
    God calling yet!  shall I not rise?
    Can I his loving voice despise,
    And basely his kind care repay?
    He calls me still; can I delay?

    3.
    God calling yet!  and shall he knock,
    And I my heart the closer lock?
    He still is waiting to receive,
    And shall I dare his Spirit grieve?

    4.
    God calling yet!  and shall I give
    No heed, but still in bondage live?
    I wait, but he does not forsake:
    He calls me still; my heart, awake!

    5.
    God calling yet!  I cannot stay;
    My heart I yield without delay;
    Vain world, farewell!  from thee I part;
    The voice of God hath reached my heart.
