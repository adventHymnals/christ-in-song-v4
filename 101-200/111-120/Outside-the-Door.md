    1.
    O Jesus!  thou art standing
    Outside the fast-closed door,
    In lowly patience waiting
    To pass the threshold o'er:
    We bear the name of Christians,
    Thy name and sign we bear:
    O, shame, thrice shame upon us!
    To keep thee standing there.

    2.
    O Jesus!  thou art knocking;
    And lo!  that hand is scarred,
    And thorns thy brow encircle,
    And tears thy face have marred;
    O, love that passeth knowledge,
    So patiently to wait!
    O, sin that hath no equal,
    So fast to bar the gate!

    3.
    O Jesus!  thou art pleading
    In accents meek and low,
    "I died for you, my children,
    And will ye treat me so?"
    O Lord, with shame and sorrow
    We open now the door:
    Dear Saviour, quickly enter,
    And leave us nevermore!
