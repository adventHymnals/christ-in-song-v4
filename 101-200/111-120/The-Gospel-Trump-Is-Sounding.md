[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G_3Ealrh1SZzaeMxdwXxAueOydoV6KJ2/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The gospel trump is sounding
    The year of jubilee,
    And grace is all abounding,
    To set the bondmen free.
    Forsake your wretched service,
    Your Master's claims are o'er;
    Avail yourselves of freedom,
    Be Satan's slaves no more.

    2.
    A better Master's calling,
    In accents true and kind;
    He asks a loving service,
    And claims a willing mind.
    He offers you salvation,
    And points to joys above;
    And, longing, waits to make you
    The objects of his love.

    3.
    In living faith accept him,
    Give up all else beside;
    While grace is loudly calling,
    Look to the Crucified.
    Return, return, ye captives,
    Return unto your home,
    The gospel trump is sounding, 
    The jubilee is come.
