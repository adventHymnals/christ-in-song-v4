[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LSGj2OrWkNrp1hOhxrAjjR_Tjicvq0nR/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I hear the Saviour say,
    "Thy strength indeed is small;
    Child of weakness, watch and pray,
    Find in me thine all in all."

    Refrain:
    Jesus paid it all,
    All to him I owe;
    Sin had left a crimson stain:
    He washed it white as snow.

    2.
    Lord, now indeed I find
    Thy pow'r, and thine alone,
    Can change the leper's spots,
    And melt the heart of stone.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Since nothing good have I
    Whereby thy grace to claim,
    I'll wash my garments white
    In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.  [Refrain]

    4.
    And when before the throne
    I stand in him complete,
    I'll lay my trophies down,
    All down at Jesus' feet.  [Refrain]
