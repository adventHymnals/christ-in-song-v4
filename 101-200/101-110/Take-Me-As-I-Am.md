    1.
    Jesus, my Lord, to thee I cry;
    Unless thou help me I must die;
    Oh, bring thy free salvation nigh,
    And take me as I am.

    Refrain:
    Take me as I am,
    Take me as I am,
    Oh, bring thy free salvation nigh,
    And take me as I am.

    2.
    Helpless I am, and full of guilt,
    But yet thy blood for me was spilt;
    And thou canst make me what thou wilt,
    But take me as I am.  [Refrain]

    3.
    No preparation can I make,
    My best resolves I only break;
    Yet save me for thine own name's sake,
    And take me as I am.  [Refrain]

    4.
    I bow before thy mercy seat,
    Behold me, Savior, at thy feet;
    Thy work begin, thy work complete, 
    And take me as I am.  [Refrain]

    5.
    If thou hast work for me to do,
    Inspire my will, my heart renew;
    And work both in, and by me, too,
    And take me as I am.  [Refrain]

    6.
    And when at last the work is done,
    The battle fought, the vict'ry won,
    Still, still my cry shall be alone,
    Lord, take me as I am.  [Refrain]
