[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LRPMGNCPrKEa43gvDcPxezECFuFpma92/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I am coming to the cross,
    I am poor, and weak, and blind;
    I am counting all but dross,
    I shall full salvation find.

    Refrain:
    I am trusting, Lord, in thee,
    Blessed Lamb of Calvary!
    Humbly at thy cross I bow,
    Save me, Jesus, save me now.

    2.
    Long my heart has sigh'd for thee,
    Long has evil reigned within;
    Jesus sweetly speaks to me,
    "I will cleanse you from all sin."  [Refrain]

    3.
    Here I give my all to thee,
    Friends and time and earthly store;
    Soul and body thine to be,
    Wholly thine forevermore.  [Refrain]

    4.
    In thy promises I trust,
    Now I feel the blood applied;
    I am prostrate in the dust,
    I with Christ am crucified.  [Refrain]

    5.
    Jesus comes!  he fills my soul;
    Perfected in him I am;
    I am ev'ry whit made whole;
    Glory, glory to the Lamb!  

    Refrain:
    I am trusting, Lord, in thee,
    Blessed Lamb of Calvary!
    Humbly at thy cross I bow,
    Jesus saves me, saves me now.
