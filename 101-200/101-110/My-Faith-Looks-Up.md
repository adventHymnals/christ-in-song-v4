[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L7Peic8TI0u_KG8tUf1FYMZ_7_Qu77BO/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    My faith looks up to thee,
    Thou Lamb of Calvary,
    Saviour divine!
    Now hear me while I pray,
    Take all my guilt away,
    O, let me from this day
    Be wholly thine!

    2.
    May thy rich grace impart
    Strength to my fainting heart,
    My zeal inspire;
    As thou hast died for me,
    O, may my love to thee,
    Pure, warm, and changeless be,
    A living fire!

    3.
    While life's dark maze I tread,
    And griefs around me spread,
    Be thou my guide;
    Bid darkness turn to day,
    Wipe sorrow's tears away,
    Nor let me ever stray
    From thee aside.
