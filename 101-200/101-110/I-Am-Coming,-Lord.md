    1.
    I hear thy welcome voice,
    That calls me, Lord, to thee;
    For cleansing in thy precious blood,
    That flow'd on Calvary.

    Chorus:
    I am coming, Lord!
    Coming now to thee!
    Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood
    That flow'd on Calvary.

    2.
    Tho' coming weak and vile,
    Thou dost my strength assure;
    Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,
    Till spotless all, and pure.  [Chorus]

    3.
    'Tis Jesus calls me on
    To perfect faith and love,
    To perfect hope, and peace, and trust,
    For earth and heav'n above.  [Chorus]

    4.
    All hail, atoning blood!
    All hail, redeeming grace!
    All hail!  the gift of Christ, our Lord,
    Our Strength and Righteousness.  [Chorus]
