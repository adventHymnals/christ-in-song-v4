[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LSg6fbv17pZ9tcynt13IJwcvAWeCtTG9/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
    Trusting only Thee;
    Trusting Thee for full salvation,
    Great and free.

    2.
    I am trusting Thee for pardon;
    At Thy feet I bow;
    For Thy grace and tender mercy,
    Trusting now.

    3.
    I am trusting Thee to guide me;
    Thou alone shalt lead,
    Ev'ry day and hour supplying
    All my need.

    4.
    I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus;
    Never let me fall;
    I am trusting Thee forever,
    And for all.  Amen.
