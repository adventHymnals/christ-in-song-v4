    1.
    I was once far away from the Saviour,
    And as vile as a sinner could be;
    I wondered if Christ, the Redeemer,
    Could save a poor sinner like me.

    2.
    I wandered on in the darkness,
    Not a ray of light could I see,
    And the tho't filled my heart with sadness,
    There's no help for a sinner like me.

    3.
    And then in that dark, lonely hour,
    A voice sweetly whispered to me,
    Saying Christ, the Redeemer, has power
    To save a poor sinner like me.

    4.
    I listened, and lo!  'twas the Savior
    Who was speaking so kindly to me;
    I cried, I'm the chief of sinners,
    Oh, save a poor sinner like me.

    5.
    I then fully trusted in Jesus,
    And, oh, what a joy came to me!
    My heart was filled with his praises,
    For saving a sinner like me.

    6.
    No longer in darkness I'm walking,
    For the light is now shining on me,
    And now unto others I'm telling
    How he saved a poor sinner like me.

    7.
    And when life's journey is over,
    And I the dear Saviour shall see,
    I'll praise him for ever and ever,
    For saving a sinner like me.
