    1.
    The tempter to my soul hath said, 
    "There is no help in God for thee;"
    Lord, lift thou up thy servant's head;
    My glory, shield, and solace be.

    2.
    Thus to the Lord I raised my cry;
    He heard me from his holy hill;
    At his command the waves rolled by;
    He beckoned, and the winds were still.

    3.
    I will not fear, tho' armed throngs
    Compass my steps in all their wrath;
    Salvation to the Lord belongs;
    His presence guards his people's path.
