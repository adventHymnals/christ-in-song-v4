[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdgyjkGeifd4RUgn4bivrol1I6MQB2y5/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    So let our lips and lives express
    The holy gospel we profess;
    So let our works and virtues shine,
    To prove the doctrine all divine.

    2.
    Thus shall we best proclaim abroad
    The honors of our gracious Lord,
    When his salvation reigns within,
    And grace subdues the pow'r of sin.

    3.
    Our flesh and sense must be denied,
    Passion and envy, lust and pride;
    While justice, temp'rance, truth, and love,
    Our inward piety approve.
