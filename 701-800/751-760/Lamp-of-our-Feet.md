    1.
    Lamp of our feet, Whereby we trace
    Our path when wont to stray;
    Stream from the Fount of heav'nly grace;
    Brook by the trav'ler's way;

    2.
    Bread of our souls, Whereon we feed;
    True manna from on high;
    Our guide and chart, wherein we read
    Of realms beyond the sky;

    3.
    Pillar of fire thro' watches dark,
    And radiant cloud by day;
    When waves would whelm our tossing bark,
    Our anchor and our stay;

    4.
    Word of the everlasting God;
    Will of his glorious Son,
    Without thee how could earth be trod,
    Or heav'n itself be won?
