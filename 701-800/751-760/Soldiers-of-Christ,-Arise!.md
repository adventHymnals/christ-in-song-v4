    1.
    Soldiers of Christ, arise,
    And put your armor on;
    Fight, for the battle will be ours;
    We fight to win a crown.

    2.
    We fight not against flesh,
    We wrestle not with blood;
    But principalities and pow'rs,
    And for the truth of God;

    3.
    With wicked spirits, too,
    That in high places stand,
    Perverting oft the word of God,
    And say 'tis by command.
