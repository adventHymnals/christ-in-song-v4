[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BoJUAH_9ho9NRDU3rTjzqdBNs_6F0ZRR/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Happy the home when God is there,
    And love fills ev'ry breast;
    When one their wish, and one their prayer.
    And one their heav'nly rest.

    2.
    Happy the home where Jesus' name
    Is sweet to ev'ry ear;
    Where children early lisp his fame,
    And parents hold him dear.

    3.
    Happy the home where prayer is heard,
    And praise is wont to rise;
    Where parents love the sacred word,
    And live out for the skies.

    4.
    Lord, may we in our homes agree,
    This blessed peace to gain;
    Unite our hearts in love to thee,
    And love to all will reign.
