    1.
    Children of the heav'nly King
    As we journey, sweetly sing;
    Sing your Saviour's worthy praise,
    Glorious in his works and ways.

    2.
    We are trav'ling home to God,
    In the way the fathers trod;
    And when Christ our Lord shall come,
    We shall all be gathered home.

    3.
    Shout, ye little flock, and blest,
    You near Jesus' throne shall rest;
    There your seats are now prepared,
    There your kingdom and reward.

    4.
    Fear not, brethren, joyful stand
    On the borders of your land;
    Jesus Christ, your Father's Son,
    Bids you undismayed go on.
