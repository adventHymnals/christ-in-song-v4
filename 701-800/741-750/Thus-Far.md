## 744.  Thus Far
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Ba8GNGbmBoDIOhcshyGTbhHFDg2RQ2K/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Thus far the Lord has led me on;
    Thus far his pow'r prolongs my days;
    And ev'ry evening shall make known
    Some fresh memorial of his grace.

    2.
    Much of my time has run to waste,
    And I, perhaps, am near my home;
    But he forgives my follies past,
    And gives me strength for days to come.

    3.
    I lay my body down to sleep;
    Peace is the pillow for my head;
    While well-appointed angels keep
    Their watchful stations round my bed.
