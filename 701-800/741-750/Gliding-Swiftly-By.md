    1.
    My days are gliding swiftly by,
    And I, a pilgrim stranger,
    Would not detain them as they fly
    These hours of toil and danger;

    Chorus:
    For O, we stand on Jordan's strand,
    And soon we'll all pass over;
    And just before, the shining shore,
    We may almost discover.

    2.
    We'll gird our loins, my brethren dear,
    Our distant home discerning;
    Our absent Lord has left us word,
    Let ev'ry lamp be burning.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Should coming days be cold and dark,
    We need not cease our singing;
    That perfect rest naught can molest,
    Where golden harps are ringing.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Let sorrow's rudest tempests blow,
    Each cord on earth to sever,
    Our King says, Come, and there's our home, 
    Forever, O, forever!  [Chorus]
