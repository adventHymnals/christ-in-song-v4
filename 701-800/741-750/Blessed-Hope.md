    1.
    There is a blessed hope,
    More precious and more bright
    Than all the joyless mockery
    The world esteems delight.

    2.
    There is a lovely star
    That lights the darkest gloom,
    And sheds a peaceful radiance o'er
    The prospects of the tomb.

    3.
    There is a cheering voice
    That lifts the soul above,
    Dispels the painful, anxious doubt,
    And whispers, "God is love."

    4.
    That voice from Calv'ry's height
    Proclaims the soul forgiv'n;
    That star is revelation's light,
    That hope, the hope of heav'n.
