[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18zslQ5oXJMNeeUBvlR6inb706RWr%2DK7g/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I ask not, Lord, for less to bear
    Here in the narrow way,
    But that I may thy blessing share
    In all I do or say,
    In all I do or say.

    2.
    With thee to lead, I will not fear
    In scenes with danger rife,
    While still thy cheering voice I hear,
    "I am the Way, the Life,
    I am the Way, the Life."

    3.
    Then help me to improve with care,
    These precious moments giv'n;
    For they a faithful record bear,
    Of good or ill, to Heav'n,
    Of good or ill, to Heav'n.
