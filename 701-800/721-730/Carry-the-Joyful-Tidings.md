[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19mMhyjdWVPI1z_ChT0swIhQdIn1t%2DuhA/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Carry the joyful tidings
    To every land and sea;
    Banish the heart dividings,
    Brothers should brothers be;
    Christ died for all the nations,
    "One flesh and blood," saith he;
    There are no tribes or stations;
    One in the Lord are we.

    2.
    God who hath lent his talents,
    Bids us his service choose;
    God who hath lent his riches,
    Bids us in kindness use;
    God who hath freedom given,
    Calls us to make it known;
    He is preparing heaven
    Not for ourselves alone.

    3.
    Souls on the Orient mountains,
    Souls in the Northern snows,
    Souls by the Southern fountains
    Souls where the sunset glows;
    Souls out of Christ the Saviour;
    O for a Church of love,
    Bearing the priceless favor,
    Pointing the lost above!
