    1.
    Saviour, like a shepherd lead us;
    Much we need thy tender care;
    In thy pleasant pastures feed us,
    For our use thy fold prepare;
    Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
    Thou hast bought us, thine we are;
    Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
    Thou hast bought us, thine we are.

    2.
    We are thine, do thou befriend us,
    Be the Guardian of our way;
    Keep thy flock, from sin defend us,
    Seek us when we go astray,
    Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
    Hear, O hear us, when we pray;
    Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
    Hear, O hear us, when we pray.

    3.
    Thou hast promised to receive us,
    Poor and sinful tho' we be;
    Thou hast mercy to relieve us,
    Grace to cleanse, and pow'r to free.
    Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
    We will early turn to thee;
    Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
    We will early turn to thee.
