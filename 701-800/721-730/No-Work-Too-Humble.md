[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19y1BTNbW6KSUoDHZK_VBP%2Dzfpeol0DG5/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    There is no work too humble
    For Christian hands to do;
    There is no path too lowly
    For our feet to pursue;
    Our blessed Lord and Master
    Was servant unto all;
    None were to poor and needy
    For him to heed their call.

    2.
    If we are his disciples,
    Call'd by his holy name,
    A portion of his Spirit
    We surely ought to claim.
    And tho' the task be menial
    Which he for us hath set;
    His own divine example
    We never should forget.

    3.
    That he, the High and Holy,
    Whose life-work was complete,
    Should gird himself for labor,
    And washed those humble feet!
    And yet we shrink from duties
    Which seem so far above
    This deed of Christ-like meekness,
    This tender proof of love!
