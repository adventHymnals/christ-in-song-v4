    1.
    God moves in a mysterious way
    His wonders to perform:
    He plants His footsteps in the sea,
    And rides upon the storm.

    2.
    Deep in unfathomable mines
    Of never-feeling skill,
    He treasures up His bright designs,
    And works His sovereign will.

    3.
    Ye faithful saints, fresh courage take!
    The clouds ye so much dread,
    Are big with mercy, and will break
    In blessings on your head.

    4.
    Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
    But trust Him for His grace;
    Behind a frowning providence
    He hides a smiling face.

    5.
    Blind unbelief is sure to err,
    And scan His work in vain;
    God is His own interpreter,
    And He will make it plain.
