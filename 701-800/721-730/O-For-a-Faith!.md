[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19uuuoBN6QtR5N49X_tNlbRzt43fkUxwK/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O for a faith that will not shrink,
    Tho' press'd by many a foe;
    That will not tremble on the brink
    Of poverty or woe;

    2.
    That will not murmur or complain
    Beneath the chast'ning rod,
    But in the hour of grief or pain
    Can lean upon its God.

    3.
    A faith that shines more bright and clear
    When tempests rage without;
    Then when in danger knows no fear,
    In darkness feels no doubt;

    4.
    That bears unmoved the world's dread frown,
    Nor heeds its scornful smile;
    That sin's wild ocean cannot drown,
    Nor its soft arts beguile.

    5.
    Lord, give me such a faith as this,
    And then, whate'er may come,
    I'll taste e'en here the hallowed bliss
    Of an eternal home.
