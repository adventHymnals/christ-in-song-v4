    1.
    We bless Thee for Thy peace, O God,
    Deep as th' unfathomed sea,
    Which falls like sunshine on the road
    Of those who trust in Thee.

    2.
    We ask not, Father, for repose
    Which comes from outward rest,
    If we may have thro' all life's woes
    Thy peace within our breast,

    3.
    That peace which suffers and is strong
    Trusts where it cannot see,
    Deems not the trial way too long,
    But leaves the end with Thee.

    4.
    That peace which flows serene and deep
    A river in the soul
    Whose banks a living verdure keep,
    God's sunshine o'er the whole.

    5.
    O Father, give our hearts this peace,
    Whate'er the outward be,
    Till all life's discipline shall cease,
    And we go home to Thee.
