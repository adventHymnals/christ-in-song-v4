    1.
    Awake my soul!  stretch ev'ry nerve,
    And press with vigor on;
    A heav'nly race demands thy zeal,
    And an immortal crown.

    2.
    'Tis God's all animating voice,
    That calls thee from on high;
    'Tis he whose hand presents the prize
    To thine aspiring eye.

    3.
    A cloud of witnesses around,
    Hold thee in full survey;
    Forget the steps already trod,
    And onward urge thy way.

    4.
    Blest Saviour, introduced by thee,
    Our race have we begun;
    And, crown'd with vict'ry, at thy feet
    We'll lay our trophies down.
