[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DDdhazW0FdSKO8cJew47GrT8V0H%2Dsc15/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Gently think, and gently speak,
    Art thou strong?  respect the weak;
    Art thou weak?  from what thou art,
    Gently touch another's heart.

    2.
    He who knew the thoughts of men,
    Gentle was; O let us then
    Careful be in thought and tone,
    We, who scarce can read our own.

    3.
    Rain and dews, and sunshine fall,
    With unbounded love, on all;
    Shall my narrow heart refuse
    Its poor sun, and rain, and dews?

    4.
    Then be gentle, O my soul,
    Thoughts and words alike control;
    If thou must in aught decide,
    Err upon the gentle side.
