[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D7dFHLXBKdPj0khDCePKlRAEhBQ7GP3M/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    O Master, let me walk with thee
    In lowly paths of service free;
    Tell me thy secret, help me bear
    The strain of toil, the fret o care.

    2.
    Help me the slow of heart to move
    By some clear winning word of love;
    Teach me the wayward feet to stay,
    And guide them in the homeward way.

    3.
    Teach me thy patience; still with thee
    In closer, dearer company,
    In work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
    In trust that triumphs over wrong;

    4.
    In hope that sends a shining ray
    Far down the future's broad'ning way;
    In peace that wealth can never give,
    With thee, O Master, let me live.
