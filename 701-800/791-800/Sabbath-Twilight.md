    1.
    Softly fades the twilight ray
    Of the holy Sabbath-day,
    Gently as life's setting sun
    When the Christian's course is run.

    2.
    Peace is on the world abroad;
    'Tis the holy peace of God,
    Symbol of the peace within
    When the spirit rests from sin.

    3.
    Saviour, may our Sabbaths be
    Days of joy and peace in Thee,
    Till in heav'n our souls repose, 
    Where the Sabbath ne'er shall close.
