## 795.  Spend And Be Spent
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CeORs5b2FS6oUZQQ0osT0DUboq_ve2He/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Go, labor on; spend and be spent,
    Thy joy to do the Father's will;
    It is the way the Master went;
    Should not the servant tread it still?

    2.
    Go, labor on; 'tis not for naught;
    Thine earthly loss is heav'nly gain:
    Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not:
    The Master praises, what are men?

    3.
    Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice;
    For toil comes rest; for exile, home;
    Soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom's voice,
    The midnight peal:  "Behold, I come!"
