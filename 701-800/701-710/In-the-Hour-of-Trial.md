[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dc9HPScfsWsl5V9FrDqMVHF_UieSOwvI/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    In the hour of trial,
    Father, strengthen me;
    Lest by base denial,
    I depart from thee.
    When thou see'st me waver,
    With a touch recall,
    Nor from thy dear favor,
    Suffer me to fall.

    2.
    With forbidden pleasures
    Would this vain world charm,
    Or its sordid treasures 
    Spread to work me harm;
    By thy love sustaining,
    Father keep thy child;
    All my foes restraining,
    And my passions wild.

    3.
    Should thy mercy send me
    Sorrow, care, and woe;
    Or should pain attend me
    On my path below:
    Grant that I may never
    Fail thy hand to see;
    Grant that I may ever
    Cast my care on thee.  Amen.
