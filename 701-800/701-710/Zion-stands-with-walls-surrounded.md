    1.
    Zion stand with walls surrounded,
    Zion, kept by pow'r divine:
    All her foes shall be comfounded,
    Though the world in arms combine:
    Happy Zion,
    What a favored lot is thine!

    2.
    Ev'ry human tie may perish;
    Friend to friend unfaithful prove;
    Mothers cease their own to cherish;
    Heav'n and earth at last remove:
    But no changes
    Can attend Jehovah's love.

    3.
    In the furnace God may prove thee,
    Thence to bring thee forth more bright;
    But can never cease to love thee:
    Thou art precious in his sight:
    God is with thee,
    God, thine everlasting light.
