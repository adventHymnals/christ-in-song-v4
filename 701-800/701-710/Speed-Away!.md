[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1De6qu_gL5dangigLpBtPb1jSwYyQ75rw/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Speed away!  speed away, over mountain and sea,
    To the hearts that are waiting with welcome for thee;
    There are eyes that will gleam with the glad gospel light,
    There are feet that will walk in the pathway of right,
    There are voices to sing  
    Praise to Jesus the King:
    Speed away!  speed away!  Speed away!

    2.
    Speed away!  speed away from thy home fair and bright,
    To the homes that are darken'd by sin's starless night,
    Tho' the world with its pleasures invite thee to stay,
    Tho' the lov'd ones entreat thee "good-bye" to delay
    Look away thro' the tears,
    To eternity's years:
    Speed away!  speed away!  Speed away!

    3.
    Speed away!  speed away, with the love of thy Lord,
    With the glorious tidings revealed in his word:
    Bear the Bethlehem story with gladness to men,
    Bid the world to prepare for His coming again;
    Free salvation proclaim 
    Thro' Immanuel's name:  
    Speed away!  speed away!  Speed away!
