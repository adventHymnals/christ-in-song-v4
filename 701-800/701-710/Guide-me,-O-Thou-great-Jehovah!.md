    1.
    Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah!
    Pilgrim through this barren land:
    I am weak, but thou art mighty;
    Hold me with thy pow'rful hand:
    Bread of heaven,
    Feed me till I want no more.

    2.
    Open now the crystal fountain,
    Whence the healing waters flow;
    Let the fiery, cloudy pillar,
    Lead me all my journey through:
    Strong Deliv'rer,
    Be thou still my strength and shield.

    3.
    When I tread the verge of Jordan,
    Bid my anxious fears subside:
    Bear me through the swelling current,
    Land me safe on Canaan's side;
    Songs of praises
    I will ever give to thee.
