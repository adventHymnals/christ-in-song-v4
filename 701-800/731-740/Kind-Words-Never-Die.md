    1.
    Kind words can never die,
    Cherish'd and blest;
    God knows how deep they lie,
    Stored in the breast,
    Like childhood's simple rhymes,
    Said o'er a thousand times,
    Yes, in all years and climes,
    Distant or near.

    Refrain:
    Kind words can never die,
    Never die, never die;
    Kind words can never die,
    No, never die.

    2.
    Sweet thot's can never die,
    Tho' like the flow'rs
    Their brightest hues may fly
    In wint'ry hours;
    But when the gentle dew
    Gives them their charms anew,
    With many an added hue
    They bloom again.

    Refrain:
    Sweet words can never die,
    Never die, never die;
    Sweet tho'ts can never die,
    No, never die.

    3.
    True love can never die,
    Tho' in the tomb
    We all may silent lie,
    Wrapp'd in its gloom;
    Tho' mortal flesh decay,
    There comes a glorious day,
    When dust shall soar away
    To Christ above.

    Refrain:
    True love can never die,
    Never die, never die;
    True love can never die,
    No, never die.
