    1.
    Gracious Father, guard thy children
    From the foe's destructive pow'r;
    Save O save them, Lord, from falling
    In this dark and trying hour.
    Thou wilt surely prove thy people,
    All our graces must be tried; 
    But thy word illumes our pathway,
    And in God we still confide.

    2.
     We are in the time of waiting;
    Soon we shall behold our Lord,
    Wafted far away from sorrow,
    To receive our rich reward.
    Keep us, Lord, till thine appearing,
    Pure, unspotted from the world;
    Let thy Holy Spirit cheer us
    Till thy banner is unfurled.
