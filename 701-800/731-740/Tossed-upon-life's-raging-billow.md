    1.
    Tossed upon life's raging billow.
    Sweet it is, O Lord, to know
    Thou didst press a sailor's pillow.
    Thou canst feel a sailor's woe;
    Never slumb'ring, never sleeping.
    Tho' the night be dark and drear,
    Thou the faithful watch art keeping;
    "All is well," thy constant cheer.

    2.
    Thou my heart the hope will cherish,
    While to thee I lift mine eye,
    Thou wilt save me o'er I perish,
    Thou wilt hear the sailor's cry;
    And the mast and sail be riven,
    Soon life's voyage will be o'er;
    Safely moored in heav'n's wide haven,
    Storm and temptest vex no more.
