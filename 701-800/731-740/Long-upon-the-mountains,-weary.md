    1.
    Long upon the mountains, weary.
    Have the scattered flock been torn;
    Dark the desert paths, and dreary;
    Grievous trials have they borne.
    Now the gath'ring call is sounding,
    Solemn in its warning voice;
    Union, faith, and love, abounding,
    Bid the little flock rejoice.

    2.
    Now the light of truth they're seeking.
    In its onward track pursue;
    All the ten commandments keeping,
    They are holy, just, and true.
    On the words of life they're feeding,
    Precious to their taste, so sweet;
    All their Master's precepts heeding,
    Bowing humbly at his feet.

    3.
    Soon He comes, with clouds descending;
    All his saints, entombed, arise;
    The redeemed, in anthems blending,
    Shout their vict'ry thro' the skies.
    O, we long for thine appearing!
    Come, O Saviour, quickly come!
    Blessed hope!  our spirits cheering,
    Take thy ransomed children home.
