    1.
    Meek and lowly, pure and holy.
    Chief among the blessed three.
    Turning sadness into gladness,
    Heav'n born art thou, charity!
    Pity dwelleth in thy bosom.
    Kindness reigneth o'er thy heart;
    Gentle thoughts alone can sway thee
    Judgment hath in thee no part.

    2.
    Hoping ever, failing never.
    Though deceived, believing still;
    Long abiding, all confiding
    To thy heav'nly Father's will;
    Never weary of well-doing.
    Never fearful of the end;
    Claiming all mankind as brothers,
    Thou dost all alike befriend.
