    1.
    Always with us, always with us,
    Words of cheer and words of love;
    Thus the risen Saviour whispers,
    From his dwelling place above.
    With us when we toil in sadness,
    Sowing much and reaping none;
    Telling us that in the future, 
    Golden harvest shall be won.

    2.
    With us when the storm is sweeping
    O'er our pathway dark and drear;
    Waking hope within our bosoms,
    Stilling ev'ry anxious fear.
    With us in the lonely valley,
    When we cross the chilling stream;
    Lighting up the gloomy shadows
    With salvation's radiant beam.
