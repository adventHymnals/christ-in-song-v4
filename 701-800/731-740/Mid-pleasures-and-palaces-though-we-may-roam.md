    1.
    Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam.
    Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home!
    A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,
    Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.

    Refrain:
    Home, home, sweet, sweet home;
    Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.

    2.
    An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain,
    O give me my lowly thatched cottage again;
    The birds singing gaily, that came at my call,
    And with them, God's peace, which is dearer than all.  [Refrain]
