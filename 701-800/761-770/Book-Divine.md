    1.
    Holy Bible!  book divine!
    Precious treasure, thou art mine!
    Mine to tell me whence I came;
    Mine to teach me what I am;

    2.
    Mine to chide me when I rove;
    Mine to show a Saviour's love;
    Mine to guide my wayward feet;
    Mine to judge, condemn, acquit;

    3.
    Mine to comfort in distress,
    If the Holy Spirit bless;
    Mine to show by living faith,
    Man can triumph over death;

    4.
    Mine to tell of joys to come,
    In the saints' eternal home:
    O thou holy Book divine,
    Precious treasure, thou art mine!
