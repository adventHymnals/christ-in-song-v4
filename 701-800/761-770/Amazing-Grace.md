    1.
    Amazing grace!  how sweet the sound
    That saved a wretch like me!
    I once was lost, but now am found;
    Was blind, but now I see.

    2.
    'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
    And grace my fears relieved;
    How precious did that grace appear,
    The hour I first believed!

    3.
    Thro' many dangers, toils, and snares,
    I have already come;
    'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
    And grace will lead me home.
