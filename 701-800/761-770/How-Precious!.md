    1.
    How precious is the book divine,
    By inspiration giv'n!
    Bright as a lamp its doctrines shine,
    To guide our souls to heav'n.

    2.
    It sweetly cheers our drooping hearts
    In this dark vale of tears,
    And life and light and joy imparts,
    To banish all our fears.

    3.
    This lamp, thro' all the tedious night
    Of life, shall guide our way,
    Till we behold the clearer light
    Of an eternal day.
