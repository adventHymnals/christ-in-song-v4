    1.
    I know that my Redeemer lives,
    And ever prays for me;
    A token of his love he gives,
    A pledge of liberty.

    2.
    Joyful in hope, my spirit soars
    To meet thee from above;
    Thy goodness thankfully adores,
    And tastes thy precious love.

    3.
    When God is mine, and I am his,
    Of paradise possessed,
    I taste unutterable bliss,
    And everlasting rest.
