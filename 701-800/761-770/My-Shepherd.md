[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdomEB%2D_J_9MMg4eswQrQWF3k5Wu4kZM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want;
    He makes me down to lie
    In pastures green; he leadeth me
    The quiet waters by.

    2.
    My soul He doth restore again;
    And me to walk doth make
    Within the paths of righteousness,
    Ev'n for his own name's sake.

    3.
    Yea, tho' I walk in death's dark vale,
    Yet will I fear none ill;
    For thou art with me; and thy rod
    And staff do comfort still.
