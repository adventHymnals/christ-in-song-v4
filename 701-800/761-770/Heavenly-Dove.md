    1.
    Come, Holy Spirit, heav'nly Dove,
    With all thy quick'ning pow'rs;
    Kindle a flame of sacred love
    In these cold hearts of ours.

    2.
    O raise our thoughts from things below,
    From vanities and toys!
    Then shall we with fresh courage go
    To reach eternal joys.

    3.
    Awake our souls to joyful songs;
    Let pure devotions rise;
    Till praise employs our thankful tongues,
    And doubt forever dies.
