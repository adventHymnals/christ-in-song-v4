    1.
    God make my life a little light 
    Within the world to glow.
    A little flame that burneth bright,
    Wherever I may go.

    2.
    God make my life a little flow'r,
    That giveth joy to all,
    Content to bloom in native bow'r,
    Altho' the place be small.

    3.
    God make my life a little song
    That comforteth the sad;
    That helpeth others to be strong,
    And makes the singer glad.

    4.
    God make my life a little staff,
    Whereon the weak may rest,
    That so what health and strength I have
    May serve my neighbors best.
