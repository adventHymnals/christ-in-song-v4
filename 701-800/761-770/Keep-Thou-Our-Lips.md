[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C6fb6Z1z2mn1gT0s9sjkUVNbYYAEWugy/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Eternal Father, God of love,
    Creator of the universe,
    Pour out thy Spirit from above,
    As from thy temple we disperse.

    2.
    Keep thou our lips, that all we say
    May honor thee, our God and King;
    That our example day by day
    May teach the sacred truths we sing.

    3.
    Direct our wayward steps aright,
    Our Guide and Guard forever be;
    In thine eternal arms of might
    Enfold and draw us nearer thee.
