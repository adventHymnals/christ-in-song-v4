    1.
    God of love that hearest prayer,
    Kindly for thy people care,
    Who on thee alone depend;
    Love us, save us to the end.

    2.
    Save us in the prosp'rous hour,
    From the flatt'ring tempter's pow'r,
    From his unsuspected wiles,
    From the world's pernicious smiles.

    3.
    Cut off our dependence vain
    On the help of feeble man;
    Ev'ry arm of flesh remove;
    Stay us only on thy love!

    4.
    Men of worldly, low design,
    Let not these thy people join;
    Save us from the great and wise,
    Till they sink in their own eyes.
