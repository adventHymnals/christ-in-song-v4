[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BxBKI7AtqLboA9rkLHYeDXyTVScb1Be6/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I love the sacred book of God,
    No other can its place supply;
    It points me to the saints' abode,
    And bids me from destruction fly.

    2.
    Sweet book!  in thee my eyes discern
    The image of my absent Lord;
    From thy instructive page I learn
    The joys his presence will afford.

    3.
    But while I'm here, thou shalt supply 
    His place, and tell me of his love; 
    I'll read with faith's discerning eye,
    And thus partake of joys above.
