    1.
    How sweet the light of Sabbath eve!
    How soft the sunbeams ling'ring there!
    For these blest hours the world I leave,
    Wafted on wings of faith and pray'r.

    2.
    Season of rest!  the tranquil soul
    Feels the sweet calm, and melts in love;
    And while these sacred moments roll,
    Faith sees a smiling heav'n above.

    3.
    Nor will our days of toil be long;
    Our pilgrimage will soon be trod;
    And we shall join the ceaseless song,
    The endless Sabbath of our God.
