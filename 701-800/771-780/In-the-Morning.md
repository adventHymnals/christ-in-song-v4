    1.
    Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear
    My voice ascending high;
    To thee will I direct my prayer,
    To thee lift up mine eye,

    2.
    O may thy Spirit guide my feet
    In ways of righteousness!
    Make ev'ry path of duty straight
    And plain before my face.

    3.
    The men that love and fear thy name
    Shall see their hopes fulfilled;
    The mighty God will compass them
    With favor as a shield.
