    1.
    Zion, awake!  thy slumber break;
    No longer in thy sins lie down;
    His garment of salvation take,
    His beauty and His strength put on.

    2.
    Shake off the dust that blinds thy sight,
    And hides the promise from thine eyes;
    Arise, and struggle into light;
    Thy great Deliv'rer calls, Arise!

    3.
    Vessels of mercy, sons of grace,
    Be purged from ev'ry sinful stain;
    Be like your Lord, his word embrace,
    Nor bear his hallow'd name in vain.
