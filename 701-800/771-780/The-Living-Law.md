[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AH7hHIAeArqMUowLQfcFHTiOdiZH6lqM/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    My blest Redeemer and my Lord,
    I read my duty in thy word;
    But in thy life the law appears,
    Drawn out in living characters.

    2.
    What truth and love thy bosom fill!
    What zeal to do thy Father's will!
    Such zeal, and truth, and love divine
    I would transcribe, and make them mine.

    3.
    Cold mountains and the midnight air
    Witnessed the fervor of thy prayer;
    The desert thy temptations new,
    Thy conflict, and thy vict'ry too.

    4.
    Be thou my pattern; make me bear
    More of thy gracious image;
    Then God, the Judge, shall own my name
    Among the foll'wers of the Lamb.
