    1.
    "Go, preach my gospel," saith the Lord;
    "Bid the whole world my grace receive;
    He shall be saved who trusts my word,
    And they condemned who disbelieve.

    2.
    "I'll make your great commission known,
    And ye shall prove my gospel true
    By all the works that I have done,
    By all the wonders ye shall do.

    3.
    "Teach all the nations my commands;
    I'm with you till the world shall end;
    All pow'r is vested in my hands;
    I can destroy, and I defend."
