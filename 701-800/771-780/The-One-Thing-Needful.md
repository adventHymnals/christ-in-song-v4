[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ajm9WSsKSHEcridnnMwiEMN4Mzp8Nxcm/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Jesus, engrave it on my heart
    That thou the one thing needful art;
    I could from all things parted be,
    But never, never, Lord, from thee.

    2.
    Needful is thy most precious blood,
    To reconcile my soul to God;
    Needful in thy indulgent care,
    Needful thy all prevailing prayer.

    3.
    Needful art thou, my Guide, my Stay,
    Thro' all life's dark and weary way;
    Nor will at last less needful be
    To bring me home to heav'n and thee.
