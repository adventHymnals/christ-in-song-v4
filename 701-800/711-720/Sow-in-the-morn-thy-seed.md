    1.
    Sow in the morn thy seed;
    At eve hold not thy hand;
    To doubt and fear give thou no heed;
    Broadcast it o'er the land.

    2.
    Thou canst not toil in vain;
    Cold, heat, and moist, and dry,
    Shall foster and mature the grain
    For garners in the sky.

    3.
    Then, when the glorious end,
    The day of God, shall come,
    The angel reapers shall descend,
    And heav'n shout "Harvest home!"
