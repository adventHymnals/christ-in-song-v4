    1.
    The morning light is breaking,
    The darkness disappears,
    The sons of earth are waking
    To penitential tears;
    Each breeze that sweeps the ocean
    Brings tidings from afar,
    Of nations in commotion,
    Prepared for Zion's war.

    2.
    Rich dew of grace come o'er us,
    In many a gentle show'r,
    And harvest fields before us
    Are op'ning ev'ry hour;
    Each cry to heaven going,
    Abundant answer brings,
    And heav'nly gales are blowing,
    With peace upon their wings.

    3.
    Blest river of salvation,
    Pursue thy onward way;
    Flow thou to ev'ry nation, 
    Nor in thy richness stay.
    Stay not till all the lowly
    Triumphant reach their home;
    Stay not till all the holy
    Proclaim, "The Lord is come."
