[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DzTwGcmQPitKhgw8DlmNtJ_Mt2_%2DrXIC/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    "My times are in thy hand:"
    My God, I wish them there;
    My life, my friends, my all I leave
    Entirely to thy care.

    2.
    "My times are in thy hand:"
    Why should I doubt or fear?
    My Father's hand will never cause
    His child a needless tear.

    3.
    "My times are in thy hand;"
    I'll always trust in thee,
    Till I possess the promised land,
    And all thy glory see.
