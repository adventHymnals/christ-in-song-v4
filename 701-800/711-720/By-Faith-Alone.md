    1.
    If, through unruffled seas,
    Calmly to'ard heav'n we sail,
    With grateful hearts, O God, to thee,
    We'll own the fav'ring gale.
    With grateful hearts, O God, to thee,
    We'll own the fav'ring gale.

    2.
    But should the surges rise,
    And rest delay to come,
    Blest be the sorrow, kind the storm,
    Which drives us nearer home.
    Blest be the sorrow, kind the storm,
    Which drives us nearer home.

    3.
    Soon shall our doubts and fears
    All yield to thy control;
    Thy tender mercies shall illume
    The midnight of the soul.
    Thy tender mercies shall illume
    The midnight of the soul.

    4.
    Teach us in ev'ry state,
    To make thy will our own,
    And when the joys of sense depart,
    To live by faith alone.
    And when the joys of sense depart,
    To live by faith alone.
