[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ed6gMS5DlS3rOpe6KXX17XUysif0LF9F/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Revive Thy work, O Lord, Thy mighty arm make bare;
    Speak with the voice that wakes the dead, and make Thy people hear.

    2.
    Revive Thy work, O Lord, disturb this sleep of death;
    Quicken the smould'ring embers now by Thine almighty breath.

    3.
    Revive Thy work, O Lord, create soul-thirst for Thee;
    And hung'ring for the bread of life, oh, may our spirits be.

    4.
    Revive Thy work, O Lord, exalt Thy precious name;
    And by the Holy Ghost our love for Thee and Thine inflame.
