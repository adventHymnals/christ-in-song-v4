    1.
    Speak often to each other,
    To cheer the fainting mind;
    And often be your voices
    In pure devotion joined;
    Though trials may await you,
    The crown before you lies;
    Take courage, brother pilgrim,
    And soon you'll win the prize.

    2.
    Ye shall be mine, says Jesus,
    In that auspicious day
    When I make up my jewels,
    Released from cumb'rous clay;
    He'll polish and refine you
    From worthless dross and sin,
    And to his heavenly kingdom
    Will bid you enter in.

    3.
    We'll range the wide dominion
    Of our Redeemer round,
    And in dissolving raptures
    Be lost in love profound;
    While all the flaming harpers
    Begin the lasting song,
    With hallelujahs rolling
    From the unnumbered throng.
