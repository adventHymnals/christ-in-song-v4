[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EtkuvIHmjk_F%2DMblBy30y9imBRGqbk9n/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    God of our salvation, hear us;
    Bless, O bless us, ere we go;
    When we join the world, be near us,
    Lest we cold and careless grow.

    2.
    May we live in view of heaven,
    Where we hope to see thy face;
    Let thy Spirit's light be given,
    All our hidden paths to trace.

    3.
    As our steps are drawing nearer
    To the place we call our home,
    May our view of heav'n grow clearer,
    Hope more bright of joys to come.
