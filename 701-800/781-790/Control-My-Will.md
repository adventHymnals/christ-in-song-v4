    1.
    Prince of Peace, control my will,
    Bid this struggling heart be still;
    Bid my fears and doubtings cease,
    Hush my spirit into peace.

    2.
    Thou hast bought me with thy blood,
    Open'd wide the gate to God;
    Peace, I ask, but peace must be,
    Lord, in being one with thee.

    3.
    May thy will, not mine, be done,
    May thy will and mine be one;
    Chase these doubtings from my heart,
    Now thy perfect peace impart.
