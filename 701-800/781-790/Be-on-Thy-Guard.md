    1.
    My soul, be on thy guard!
    Ten thousand foes arise;
    The hosts of sin are pressing hard
    To draw thee from the skies.

    2.
    O watch, and fight, and pray!
    The battle ne'er give o'er;
    Renew it boldly ev'ry day
    And help divine implore.

    3.
    Ne'er think the vict'ry won,
    Nor lay thine armor down;
    Thy arduous task will not be done
    Till thou obtain the crown.
