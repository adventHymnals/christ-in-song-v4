    1.
    He who seeks the truth, and trembles
    At the dangers he must brave,
    Merits not the name of Freeman;
    He at best is but a slave.

    2.
    Be thou like the noble ancients:
    Scorn the threat that bids thee fear;
    Speak!  no matter what betide thee;
    Let them strike, but let them hear.

    3.
    Be thou like the first apostles,
    Be thou like heroic Paul;
    If a free thought seeks expression,
    Speak it boldly!  speak it all!

    4.
    Fearlessly face thine accusers!
    Scorn the prison, rack, or rod!
    If thou hast a truth to utter,
    Speak, and leave the rest to God.
