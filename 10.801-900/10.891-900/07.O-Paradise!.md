## 897. O PARADISE!
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O Paradise!  O Paradise!
Who doth not crave for rest?
Who would not seek the happy land
Where they that love are blest?

Refrain:
Where loyal hearts and true
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture thro' and thro',
In God's most holy sigh.

2.
O Paradise!  O Paradise!
The world is growing old;
Who would not be at rest and free
Where love is never cold?  [Refrain]

3.
O Paradise!  O Paradise!
I want to sin no more;
I want to be as pure on earth
As on thy spotless shore.  [Refrain]

4.
O Paradise!  O Paradise!
I would so faithful be,
That when my race on earth has run
That race may end in thee.  [Refrain]
