1.
Sweet promise is giv'n to all who believe,
"Behold I come quickly, mine own to receive;
Hold fast till I come; the danger is great;
Sleep not as do others; be watchful, and wait,"

Chorus:
"Hold fast till I come;" sweet promise of heavn'n,
"The kingdom restored, to you shall be giv'n."
"Come, enter my joy, sit down on my throne;
Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come."

2.
We'll "watch unto pray'r" with lamps burning bright;
He comes to all others a "thief in the night."
We know he is near, but know not the day,
As spring shows that summer is not far away.  [Chorus]

3.
Yes!  this is our hope, 'tis built on His word,
The glorious appearing of Jesus, our Lord;
Of promises all, it stands as the sum:
"Behold I come quickly, hold fast till I come."  [Chorus]
