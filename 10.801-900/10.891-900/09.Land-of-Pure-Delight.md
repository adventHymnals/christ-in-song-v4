        Christ in Song 899. Land of Pure Delight. There is a land of pure delight, Where saints immortal reign; Infinite day excludes the night, And pleasures banish pain. There everlasting spring abides, And never with'ring flow'rs, And but a little space divides This heav'nly land from ours.

## 899. LAND OF PURE DELIGHT
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
There is a land of pure delight,
Where saints immortal reign;
Infinite day excludes the night,
And pleasures banish pain.
There everlasting spring abides,
And never with'ring flow'rs,
And but a little space divides
This heav'nly land from ours.

2.
Pure is the land the saints espy,
And all the region peace;
No wanton lips nor envious eye
Can see or taste the bliss.
Those holy gates forever bar
Pollution, sin, and shame;
None shall obtain admittance there
But foll'wers of the Lamb.

3.
O could we make our doubts remove
Those gloomy doubts that rise,
And see the Canaan that we love,
With unbeclouded eyes;
Could we but climb where Moses stood,
And view the landscape o'er,
Not all this world's pretended good
Could ever charm us more.
