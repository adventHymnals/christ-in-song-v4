## 836. TEACH ME, THAT I MAY TEACH
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O teach me, Lord, that I may teach
The precious things Thou dost impart;
And wing my words, that they may reach
The hidden depths of many a heart.

2.
O fill me with Thy fulness, Lord,
Until my very heart o'erflow
In kindly tho't and glowing word,
Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.

3.
O use me, Lord, use even me,
Just as Thou wilt, and when, and where;
Until Thy blessed face I see,
Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.

```
