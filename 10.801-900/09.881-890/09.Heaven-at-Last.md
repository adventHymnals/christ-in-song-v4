####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Angel voices sweetly singing,
Echoes thro' the blue dome ringing,
News of wondrous gladness bringing;
Ah, 'tis heav'n at last!

Refrain:
Heav'n at last, heav'n at last;
O, the joyful story of heav'n at last!
Heav'n at last, heav'n at last;
Endless, boundless glory,
In heav'n at last.

2.
On the jasper threshold standing,
Like a pilgrim safely landing,
See the strange, bright scene expanding;
Ah, 'tis heav'n at last!  [Refrain]

3.
Softest voices, silver pealing,
Freshest fragrance, spirit healing,
Happy hymns around us stealing;
Ah, 'tis heav'n at last!  [Refrain]

4.
Not a teardrop ever falleth,
Not a pleasure ever palleth,
Song to song forever calleth;
Ah, 'tis heav'n at last!  [Refrain]

5.
Christ, himself, the living splendor,
Christ the sunlight, mild and tender;
Praises to the Lamb we render;
Ah, 'tis heav'n at last!  [Refrain]
