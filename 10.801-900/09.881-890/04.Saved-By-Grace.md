```txt
1.
Some day the silver cord will break,
And I no more as now shall sing;
But, O, the joy when I shall wake
Within the palace of the King!

Chorus:
And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story  Saved by grace!
And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story  Saved by grace.

2.
Some day my earthly house will fall,
I cannot tell how soon 'twill be,
But this I know my All in All
Has now a place in heav'n for me.  [Chorus]

3.
Some day, when fades the golden sun
Beneath the rosy-tinted west,
My blessed Lord shalt say, "Well done!"
And I shall enter into rest.  [Chorus]

4.
Someday; till then I'll watch and wait,
My lamp all trimmed and burning bright.
That when my Saviour ope's the gate, 
My soul to Him may take its flight.  [Chorus]
