####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Beautiful city, haven of peace,
Beautiful home where weeping shall cease;
When shall thy gates be opened to me?
When shall I rest forever in thee?

Refrain:
Beautiful city, haven of peace,
Home of the soul, where weeping shall cease;
Beautiful city, waiting for me,
When shall I rest forever in thee?

2.
Beautiful city, haven of joy,
Heavenly praise our tongues shall employ;
Glad are thy songs that never grow old,
Bright are thy walls of jasper and gold.  [Refrain]

3.
Beautiful city, haven of rest,
Beautiful mansions, home of the blest;
O how I long thy glories to see!
Beautiful city, waiting for me.  [Refrain]
