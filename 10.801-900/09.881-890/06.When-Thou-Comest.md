1.
When thou comest in Thy kingdom,
Jesus, Lord, remember me,
Thus the penitent thief entreated 
Christ, the Lord, on Calvary.

Chorus:
Never in vain, never in vain,
Faith inspire this wonderful strain.
When thou comest in Thy kingdom,
Jesus, Lord, remember me.

2.
When thou comest in Thy kingdom,
Sinful tho' my heart may be,
Like the penitent thief I pray Thee,
Jesus, Lord, remember me.  [Chorus]

3.
When thou comest in Thy kingdom,
Mounting upward to the skies,
Like the penitent thief, I pray to
Be with Thee in Paradise.  [Chorus]
