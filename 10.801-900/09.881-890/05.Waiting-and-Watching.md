        Christ in Song 885. Waiting and Watching. We know not the time when He cometh, At even, or midnight, or morn; It may be at deepening twilight, It may be at earliest dawn. He bids us to watch and be ready, Nor suffer our lights to grow dim; That when He shall come, He may find us,  All waiting and watching for Him. Chorus: Waiting and watching, Waiting and watching; Waiting and watching, Still waiting and watching for Thee.

```txt
1.
We know not the time when He cometh,
At even, or midnight, or morn;
It may be at deepening twilight,
It may be at earliest dawn.
He bids us to watch and be ready,
Nor suffer our lights to grow dim;
That when He shall come, He may find us, 
All waiting and watching for Him.

Chorus:
Waiting and watching,
Waiting and watching;
Waiting and watching,
Still waiting and watching for Thee.

2.
I think of His wonderful pity,
The price our salvation hath cost;
He left the bright mansions of glory
To suffer and die for the lost.
And sometimes I think it will please Him,
When those whom He died to redeem,
Rejoice in the hope of His coming
By waiting and watching for Him.  [Chorus]

3.
O Jesus, my loving Redeemer,
Thou knowest I cherish as dear
The hope that mine eyes shall behold Thee,
That I shall thine own welcome hear!
If to some as a Judge thou appearest,
Who forth from Thy presence would feel,
A Friend most beloved I'll greet Thee,
I'm waiting and watching for Thee.  [Chorus]
