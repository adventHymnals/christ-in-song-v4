```txt
1.
There is a land mine eye hath seen
In visions of enraptured tho't,
So bright, that all which spreads between
Is with its radiant glories fraught.

Chorus:
Oh, land of love, of joy and light
Thy glories gild earth's darkest night;
Thy tranquil shore, we, too, shall see,
When day shall break and shadows flee.

2.
A land upon whose blissful shore
There rests no shadow, falls no stain;
There those who meet shall part no more,
And those long parted meet again.  [Chorus]

3.
Its skies are not like earthly skies,
With varying hues of shade and light;
It hath no need of suns, to rise
To dissipate the gloom of night.  [Chorus]

4.
There sweeps no desolating wind
Across the calm, serene abode.
The wand'rer there a home may find
Within the paradise of God.  [Chorus]
