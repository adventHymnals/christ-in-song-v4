1.
There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes,
There's be no dark valley when Jesus comes;
There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes
To gather His loved ones home.

Refrain:
To gather His loved ones home,
To gather His loved ones home;
There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes
To gather His loved ones home.

2.
There'll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes,
There'll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes;
But a glorious morrow when Jesus comes
To gather His loved ones home.  [Refrain]

3.
There'll be no more weeping when Jesus comes,
There'll be no more weeping when Jesus comes;
But a blessed reaping when Jesus comes
To gather His loved ones home.  [Refrain]

4.
There'll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,
There'll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes;
And a joyful meeting when Jesus comes
To gather His loved ones home.  [Refrain]
