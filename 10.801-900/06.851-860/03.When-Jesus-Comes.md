1.
Down life's dark vale we wander,
Till Jesus comes;
We watch and wait and wonder,
Till Jesus comes.

Chorus
All joy His lov'd ones bringing,
When Jesus comes;
All praise thro' heaven ringing,
When Jesus comes.
All beauty bright and vernal,
When Jesus comes;
All glory, grand, eternal,
When Jesus comes.

2.
Oh, may my lamp be burning
When Jesus comes;
For Him my soul be yearning,
When Jesus comes.  [Chorus]

3.
No more heart pangs nor sadness,
When Jesus comes;
All peace and joy and gladness,
When Jesus comes.  [Chorus]

4.
All doubts and fears will vanish,
When Jesus comes;
All gloom His face will banish,
When Jesus comes.  [Chorus]

5.
He'll know the way was dreary,
When Jesus comes;
He'll know the feet grew weary,
When Jesus comes. [Chorus]

6.
He'll know what griefs oppressed me,
When Jesus comes;
Oh, how His arms will rest me!
When Jesus comes.  [Chorus]
