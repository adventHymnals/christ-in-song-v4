####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Above the clouds that veil the blue
Beyond the stars that glimmer through,
There is a home unknown to care,
Its gates ajar invite me there.

Chorus:
O home of beauty, free from sorrow!
O everlasting glad tomorrow!

2.
The stream of life with ceaseless flow,
The holy joy that angels know,
The golden harp, the song divine,
The spotless robe Faith calls them mine.  [Chorus]

3.
The flow'rs that sleep neath winter's snow.
The loves ones lost to us below,
The voices hush'd that used to sing,
We'll find them where Christ is King.  [Chorus]

```
