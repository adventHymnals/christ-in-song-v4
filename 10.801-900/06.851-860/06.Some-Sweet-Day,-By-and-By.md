        Christ in Song 856. Some Sweet Day, By and By. We shall reach the summer land, Some sweet day, by and by; We shall press the golden strand, Some sweet day, by and by; O the loving welcome there, By the tree of life so fair! How we long that joy to share, Some sweet day, by and by.

```txt
1.
We shall reach the summer land,
Some sweet day, by and by;
We shall press the golden strand,
Some sweet day, by and by;
O the loving welcome there,
By the tree of life so fair!
How we long that joy to share,
Some sweet day, by and by.

Refrain:
By and by,
Some sweet day,
We shall meet our lov'd ones gone,
Some sweet day, by and by.

2.
At the crystal river's brink,
Some sweet day, by and by;
We shall find each broken link,
Some sweet day, by and by;
Then the star that, fading here,
Left our hearts and homes so drear,
We shall see more bright and clear,
Some sweet day, by and by.  [Refrain]

3.
Oh, these parting scenes will end,
Some sweet day, by and by;
We shall gather friend with friend,
Some sweet day, by and by;
There before our Father's throne,
When the mists and clouds have flown,
We shall know as we are known,
Some sweet day, by and by.  [Refrain]
