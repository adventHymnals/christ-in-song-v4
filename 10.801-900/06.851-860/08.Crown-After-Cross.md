#### Advent Hymnals
## 858. CROWN AFTER CROSS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Light after darkness,
Gain after loss,
Strength after weariness,
Crown after cross.
Sweet after bitter, 
Song after sigh,
Home after wandering,
Praise after cry.

Refrain:
Now comes the weeping,
Then the glad reaping,
Now comes the labor hard,
Then the reward.

2.
Sheaves after sowing,
Sun after rain,
Sight after mystery,
Peace after pain.
Joy after sorrow,
Calm after blast,
Rest after weariness 
Sweet rest at last.  [Refrain]

3.
Near after distant,
Gleam after gloom,
Love after loneliness,
Life after tomb,
After long agony,
Rapture of bliss!
Right was the pathway
Leading to this.  [Refrain]

```
