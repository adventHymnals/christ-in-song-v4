```txt
1.
Face to face with Christ my Saviour,
Face to face what will it be?
When with rapture I behold Him,
Jesus Christ who died for me.

Chorus:
Face to face shall I behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!

2.
Only faintly now, I see Him,
With the dark'ning veil between,
But a blessed day is coming,
When His glory shall be seen.  [Chorus]

3.
What rejoicing in His presence,
When are banished grief and pain,
When the crooked ways are straightened,
And the dark things shall be plain!  [Chorus]

4.
Face to face!  O!  blissful moment!
Face to face to see and know;
Face to face with my Redeemer,
Jesus Christ who loves me so.  [Chorus]
