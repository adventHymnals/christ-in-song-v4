####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Thou coming One, our wants relieve
In this our evil day;
To all thy tempted followers give
The pow'r to watch and pray.
Long as our fiery trials last, 
Long as the cross we bear,
O may our souls on thee be cast,
In all-prevailing pray'r.

2.
The pow'r of interceding grace
Give us in faith to claim;
To wrestle till we see thy face,
And know thy hidden name.
Till then thy perfect love impart;
Till thou appear below
Be this the cry of ev'ry heart,
"I will not let thee go."

3.
I will not let thee go, unless
Thou tell thy name to me;
With all thy great salvation bless,
And make me all like thee.
Then shall I on the mountain-top 
Behold thy open face,
Where faith in sight is swallowed up,
And prayer in joyful praise.
