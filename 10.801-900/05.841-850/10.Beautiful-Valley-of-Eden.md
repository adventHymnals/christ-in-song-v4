####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Beautiful valley of Eden, 
Sweet is thy noon-tide calm;
Over the hearts of the weary,
Breathing thy waves of balm.  [Chorus]

2.
Over the heart of the mourner
Shineth the golden day,
Wafting the songs of the angels
Down from the far away.  [Chorus]

3.
There is the home of my Saviour
There with the blood-washed throng;
Over the highland of glory
Rolleth the great new song.  [Chorus]
