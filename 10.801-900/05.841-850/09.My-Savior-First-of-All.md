```txt
1.
When my lifework is ended, and I cross the swelling tide,
When "this mortal puts on immortality;"
I shall know my Redeemer when I reach the other side,
And his smile will be the first to welcome me.

Chorus:
I shall know him, I shall know him
As redeemed by his side I shall stand,
I shall know him, I shall know him
By the prints of the nails in his hands.

2.
O, the soul thrilling rapture when I view his blessed face,
And the luster of his kindly beaming eye;
How my full heart will praise him for the mercy, love, and grace,
That prepares for me a mansion in the sky.  [Chorus]

3.
O, the dear ones departed!  How the tender mem'ries come,
 As the farewell at the river I recall;
In the sweet vales of Eden we shall meet no more to roam,
But I long to see my Saviour first of all.  [Chorus]

4.
Thro' the gates to the city, in a robe of spotless white,
He will lead me where no tears shall ever fall;
In the glad song of ages I shall mingle with delight;
But I long to meet my Saviour first of all  [Chorus]
