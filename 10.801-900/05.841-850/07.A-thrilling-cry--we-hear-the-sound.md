        Christ in Song 847. A thrilling cry--we hear the sound. A thrilling cry--we hear the sound; The faithful watchmen lift their voice; From land to land the world around It bids the saints rejoice; Ye pilgrims, rise, break forth and sing The glorious coming of your King; The thrilling cry--we hear it sound, "Prepare to meet your Lord."

1.
A thrilling cry--we hear the sound;
The faithful watchmen lift their voice;
From land to land the world around
It bids the saints rejoice;
Ye pilgrims, rise, break forth and sing
The glorious coming of your King;
The thrilling cry--we hear it sound,
"Prepare to meet your Lord."

2.
Blow, watchmen, blow the certain sound,
For dark and dangerous in the night;
And daring scoffers gather round
The evil servants smite.
Ye faithful ones, the strict watch keep.
With lamps well trimmed, and do not sleep
The thrilling cry--we hear it sound,
"Prepare to meet your Lord."

3.
In earth's dark hour God's word gives light,
Its rays dispel the thickening gloom;
The path to glory now is bright
The Bridegroom soon will come.
Then lift your voices, saints, and sing
Your sweetest strains to Zion's King
The thrilling cry--we hear it sound,
"Prepare to meet your Lord."
