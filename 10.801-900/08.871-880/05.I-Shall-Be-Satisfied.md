        Christ in Song 875. I Shall Be Satisfied. Soul amid earth sorrows dwelling, Sighing for the strife to cease, Lo!  the promise sweet foretelling Soon shall come the Prince of Peace. Chorus: I shall be satisfied then, I shall be satisfied then; When the King of kings, with angels attending, Rends the azure sky, in glory descending, When the saints awake in his own likeness, I shall be satisfied then.

1.
Soul amid earth sorrows dwelling,
Sighing for the strife to cease,
Lo!  the promise sweet foretelling
Soon shall come the Prince of Peace.

Chorus:
I shall be satisfied then,
I shall be satisfied then;
When the King of kings, with angels attending,
Rends the azure sky, in glory descending,
When the saints awake in his own likeness,
I shall be satisfied then.

2.
Saddened by the world's complaining,
Burdened with the ceaseless care,
Tell me!  is there rest remaining
For the toilers over there?  [Chorus]

3.
Patient wait God's time for going,
Murmur not though long thy stay,
Ever trusting, ever knowing
Thou shalt dwell with him some day.  [Chorus]

4.
Born of God, the soul can never
Willing here with sin abide;
Earth is not the glad forever
Where the soul is satisfied.  [Chorus]
