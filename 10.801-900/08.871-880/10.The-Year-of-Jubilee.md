1.
Oh, glory to God!  it is coming again,
'Tis the glad jubilee of the children of men;
Then blow ye the trumpet, shout glory and sing,
And join in the praises of Jesus the King.

Chorus:
Shout with the voice of triumph,
Soon shall the saints be free;
Glory to the Lord!  hallelujah!  
Hasten the jubilee!

2.
'Tis the glad antitype of that day long ago,
When the hosts of the Lord might not gather or sow;
When the minions of Israel from labor were free,
And the land was to rest in the glad jubilee.  [Chorus]

3.
Yes, gladder by far is that rest "by and by,"
When on wings like the eagle we mount to the sky;
We shall dwell evermore in that land of the blest,
In that grand jubilee, in that sabbath of rest. [Chorus]
