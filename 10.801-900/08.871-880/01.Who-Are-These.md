```txt
1.
Who are these whose songs are sounding
O'er the golden harps above?
Hark!  they tell of grace abounding
And Jehovah's sov'reign love.

Chorus:
These are they who wash'd their robes
and made them white in the blood of the Lamb
These are they who wash'd their robes 
and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

2.
Who are these that keep their station
Round the great eternal throne?
They from earthly tribulation
To their heav'nly rest are gone.  [Chorus]

3.
See their robes of dazzling whiteness,
Without blemish, spot or stain;
See their crowns that grow in brightness
Purchas'd by the Lamb once slain.  [Chorus]

4.
'Tis the Lamb of God who leads them,
And they serve Him night and day,
By the heav'nly fount He leads them
He hath wiped their tears away.  [Chorus]

5.
Sweet the theme:  'tis still "salvation 
Unto Christ the Holy One."
And their sighs of tribulation
Change to songs around the throne.  [Chorus]
