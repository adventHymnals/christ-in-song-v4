1.
When I shall awake in that fair morn of morns,
After whose dawning never night returns,
And with whose bright glory day eternal burns,
I shall be satisfied then.

Refrain:
I shall be satisfied then,
I shall be satisfied then.
When I shall awake, in that fair morn of morns,
I shall be satisfied then.

2.
And when I shall see His glory face to face,
Hear his glad welcome, feel his fond embrace,
And feast on the fulness of his heav'nly grace,
I shall be satisfied then.  [Refrain]

3.
And when I shall meet the friends that I have loved,
Clasp to my bosom dear ones long removed,
And witness how faithful Christ to me that proved,
I shall be satisfied then.  [Refrain]

4.
O soon I shall gaze upon the face of Him,
Pierced to redeem me from the curse of sin,
And praise him forever with the glad new hymn;
I shall be satisfied then.  [Refrain]
