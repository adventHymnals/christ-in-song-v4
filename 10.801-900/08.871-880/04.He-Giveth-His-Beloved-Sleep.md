#### Advent Hymnals
## 874. HE GIVETH HIS BELOVED SLEEP
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Sorrow and care may meet,
The tempest cloud may low'r,
The surge of sin may beat
Upon earth's troubled shore;

Refrain:
God doth his own in safety keep;
He giveth his beloved sleep,
He giveth his beloved sleep.

2.
The din of war may roll
With all its raging flight;
Grief may oppress the soul
Thro'out the weary night; [Refrain]

3.
In childhood's winsome page,
In manhood's joyous bloom,
In feebleness and age,
In death's dark, gath'ring gloom; [Refrain]
