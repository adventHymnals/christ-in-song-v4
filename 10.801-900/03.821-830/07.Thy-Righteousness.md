```txt
1.
O blest are they who oft have said, 
"I thirst for righteousness;
I hunger for the heav'nly Bread
With anguish and distress."

2.
They of My fulness shall be fed,
For which they hungered sore;
And by the Living Waters led,
Their souls shall thirst no more.

3.
Because I am the Truth, the Life,
All fulness dwells in me;
They know no want, no sin, no strife,
Thro' all eternity.

4.
How blessed, then, to share a part
With those that hunger here;
To have the panting, thirsty heart,
And shed the bitter tear!
