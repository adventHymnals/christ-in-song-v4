## 830. THE LARGER PRAYER
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
At first I prayed for light:
Could I but see the way,
How gladly, swiftly would I walk
To everlasting day!

2.
And next I prayed for strength:
That I might tread the road
With firm, unfalt'ring, feet and win
The heaven's serene abode.

3.
And then I asked for faith:
Could I but trust my God,
I'd live unfolded in His peace,
Tho' foes were all abroad.

4.
But now I pray for love:
Deep love to God and man;
A living love that will not fail,
However dark His plan.

5.
And light and strength and faith
Are opening everywhere!
God waited patiently until
I prayed the larger pray'r.
