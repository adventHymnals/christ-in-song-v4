## 828. GOD OF MY LIFE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
God of my life, whose gracious pow'r
Thro' varied scenes my soul hath led,
Or turned aside the fatal hour,
Or lifted up my sinking head,

2.
I have no skill the snare to shun,
But thou, O God, my wisdom art:
I ever into danger run,
But thou art greater than my heart.

3.
I rest beneath thy kindly shade;
My griefs expire, my troubles cease;
Thou, Lord, on whom my soul is stayed,
Wilt keep me still in perfect peace.

```
