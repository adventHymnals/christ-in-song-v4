## 807. DAY BY DAY
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Day by day the manna fell;
O to learn this lesson well!
Still by constant mercy fed,
Give me, Lord, our daily bread.

2.
"Day by day," the promise reads
Daily strength for daily needs;
Cast foreboding fears away,
Take the manna of today.

3.
Lord, our times are in thy hand;
All our sanguine hopes have plann'd
To thy wisdom we resign,
And would mold our wills to thine.

4.
Thou our daily task shalt give;
Day by day to thee we live;
So shall added years fulfil
Not our own, our Father's will.
