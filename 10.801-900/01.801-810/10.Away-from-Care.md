## 810. AWAY FROM CARE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
I love to steal awhile away
From ev'ry cumb'ring care,
And spend the hours of setting day
In humble, grateful prayer.

2.
I love in solitude to shed
The penitential tear;
And all His promises to plead,
Where none but God can hear.

3.
I love to think on mercies past,
And future good implore;
And all my cares and sorrows cast
On Him whom I adore.

4.
I love by faith to take a view
Of brighter scenes to come;
The prospect doth my strength renew
While here away from home.

```
