####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
In grief and fear, to thee, O Lord,
We now for succor fly;
Thine awful judgments are abroad,
O shield us, lest we die.

2.
O look with pity on the scene 
Of sadness and of dread;
And let thine angel stand between
The living and the dead.

3.
With contrite hearts to thee, our King,
We turn who oft have strayed;
Accept the sacrifice we bring,
And let the plague be stayed.
