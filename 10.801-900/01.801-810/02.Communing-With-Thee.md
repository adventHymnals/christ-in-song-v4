## 802. COMMUNING WITH THEE
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Softy now the light of day
Fades upon our sight away;
Free from care, from labor free,
Lord, we would commune with thee.

2.
Thou, whose all pervading eye
Naught escapes, without, within,
Pardon each infirmity,
Open fault, and secret sin.

3.
Soon from us the light of day
Shall forever pass away;
Thou, from sin and sorrow free,
Take us, Lord, to dwell with thee.

```
