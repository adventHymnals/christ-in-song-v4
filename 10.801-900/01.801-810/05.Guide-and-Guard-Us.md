## 805. GUIDE AND GUARD US
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Guide and guard us, O our Father,
Till another Sabbath-day;
Shield us with Thy holy presence,
Lead us in the righteous way.

2.
Now we thank Thee for Thy blessing
On this sacred day of rest,
And for truths which Thou hast shown us
In Thy word divinely blest.

3.
Ev'ry day and ev'ry moment
We are safe if Thou art near;
From all danger Thou canst rescue,
In our sorrows Thou canst cheer.

4.
We will trust Thy constant watch-care,
For Thou knowest what is best;
O, forever guide and guard us,
Till we reach our final rest!
