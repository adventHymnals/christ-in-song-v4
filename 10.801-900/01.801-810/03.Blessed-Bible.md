```txt
1.
Blessed Bible, how I love it!
How it doth my bosom cheer!
What hath earth like this to covet?
O, what stores of wealth are here!

2.
'Tis a fountain ever bursting,
Whence the weary may obtain
Water for the soul that's thirsting,
That it may not thirst again.

3.
'Tis a chart that never faileth,
One which God to man has giv'n;
And tho' oft the storm assaileth,
It will guide us safe to heav'n.

4.
'Tis a pearl of price exceeding
All the gems in ocean found;
All its sacred precepts heeding,
So shall we in grace abound.
