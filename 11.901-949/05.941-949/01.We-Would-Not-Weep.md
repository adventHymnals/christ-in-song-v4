## 941. WE WOULD NOT WEEP
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Dear as thou wert, and justly dear,
We would not weep for thee;
One thought shall check the starting tear:
From sorrow thou art free.

2.
And thus shall faith's consoling pow'r
The tears of love restrain:
O, who that saw thy parting hour
Could wish thee back again?

3.
Angels shall guard thy sleeping dust,
And, as thy Saviour rose,
The grave again shall yield her trust,
And end thy deep repose.

```
