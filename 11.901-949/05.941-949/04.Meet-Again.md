## 944. MEET AGAIN
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Meet again when time is o'er,
Meet again to part no more;
How it cheers the drooping heart.
When from friend we're called to part!

2.
Meet again where endless joy
We shall taste without alloy;
Meet where songs shall ne'er grow old,
Sweetly tuned to harps of gold.

3.
Meet again, how passing sweet,
Friends long lost again to meet!
Careworn souls, by temptest driv'n,
O how sweet to meet in heav'n!


```
