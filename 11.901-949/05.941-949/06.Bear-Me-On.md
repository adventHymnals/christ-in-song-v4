####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O how I long to see that day
When the redeemed shall come
To Zion, clad in white array
Their blissful, happy home.

Chorus:
O bear me on, bear me on
To Mount Zion;
O bear me on to that city of love
Where saints shall ever dwell.

2.
I'll hear the alleluias roll
From the unnumbered throng,
And with a heaven-enraptured soul
I'll join redemption's song.  [Chorus]

3.
All hail!  the morn of glory's nigh
The pilgrim longs to see
That dries the tear from every eye
Creation's jubilee.  [Chorus]

```
