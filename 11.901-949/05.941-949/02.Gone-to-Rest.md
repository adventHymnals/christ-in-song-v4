## 942. GONE TO REST
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
She/He hath passed death's chilling billow,
And gone to rest;
Jesus smoothed her/his dying pillow,
O slumber blest!

2.
When the morn of glory, breaking,
Shall light the tomb,
Beautiful will be thy waking
In fadeless bloom;

3.
Where no wintry winds are blowing,
No burial train,
Crown'd with life's celestial glowing,
We'll meet again.

```
