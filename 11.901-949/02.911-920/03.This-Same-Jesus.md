        Christ in Song 913. This Same Jesus. "This same Jesus!"  O how sweetly Fall those words upon the ear, Like the swell of far off music, In a night watch still and clear, He who healed the hopeless leper, He who dried the widow's tear, He who changed to health and gladness Helpless, suff'ring, trembling fear.

1.
"This same Jesus!"  O how sweetly
Fall those words upon the ear,
Like the swell of far off music,
In a night watch still and clear,
He who healed the hopeless leper,
He who dried the widow's tear,
He who changed to health and gladness
Helpless, suff'ring, trembling fear.

2.
"This same Jesus!"  When the vision
Of that last and awful day
Bursts upon the prostrate spirit,
Like a midnight lightning ray,
May we lift our hearts, adoring
"This same Jesus," loved and known
As our own most gracious Saviour,
Seated on the great white throne,

3.
He himself, and "not another,"
He for whom our hearts have yearned
Thro' long years of twilight waiting,
To his ransomed ones returned;
For this word, O Lord, we bless thee,
Bless our Master's changeless name;
Yesterday, today, forever, 
Jesus Christ is still the same.
