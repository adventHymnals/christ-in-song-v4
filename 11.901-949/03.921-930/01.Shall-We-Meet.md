```txt
1.
Shall we meet beyond the river,
Where the surges cease to roll?
Where, in all the bright forever,
Sorrow ne'er shall press the soul?

Refrain:
Shall we meet, shall we meet,
Shall we meet beyond the river?
Shall we meet beyond the river,
Where the surges cease to roll?

2.
Shall we meet in that blest harbor,
When our stormy voyage is o'er?
Shall we meet and cast the anchor,
By the fair, celestial shore?  [Refrain]

3.
Shall we meet in yonder city,
Where the tow'rs of crystal shine?
Where the walls are all of jasper,
Built for us by hands divine?  [Refrain]

4.
Shall we meet with Christ, our Saviour,
When he comes to claim his own?
Shall we know his blessed favor,
And sit down upon his throne?  [Refrain]
