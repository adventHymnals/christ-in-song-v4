```txt
1.
Lift up the trumpet, and loud let it ring;
Jesus is coming again!
Cheer up, ye pilgrims, be joyful and sing;
Jesus is coming again!

Chorus:
Coming again, coming again,
Jesus is coming again!

2.
Echo it, hilltops, proclaim it, ye plains;
Jesus is coming again!
Coming in glory, the Lamb that was slain;
Jesus is coming again!  [Chorus]

3.
Sound it, old ocean, in each mighty wave;
Jesus is coming again!
Break on the sands of the shores that ye lave;
Jesus is coming again!  [Chorus]

4.
Heavings of earth, tell the vast, wond'ring throng;
Jesus is coming again!
Tempests and whirlwinds, the anthem prolong;
Jesus is coming again!  [Chorus]

5.
Nations are angry, by this do we know;
Jesus is coming again!
Knowledge increases, men run to and fro;
Jesus is coming again!  [Chorus]
