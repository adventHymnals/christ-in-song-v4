        Christ in Song 927. We'll Stand the Storm. When I can read my title clear, When I can read my title clear, When I can read my title clear To mansions in the skies. I'll bid farewell to ev'ry fear, I'll bid farewell to ev'ry fear, I'll bid farewell to ev'ry fear, And wipe my weeping eyes. Chorus: We will stand the storm, We will anchor by and by, by and by; We will stand the storm, We will anchor by and by.

1.
When I can read my title clear,
When I can read my title clear,
When I can read my title clear
To mansions in the skies.
I'll bid farewell to ev'ry fear,
I'll bid farewell to ev'ry fear,
I'll bid farewell to ev'ry fear,
And wipe my weeping eyes.

Chorus:
We will stand the storm,
We will anchor by and by, by and by;
We will stand the storm,
We will anchor by and by.

2.
Should earth against my soul engage,
And fiery darts be hurled;
Then I can smile at Satan's rage,
And face a frowning world.  [Chorus]

3.
Let cares like a wild deluge come,
And storms of sorrow fall;
May I but safely reach my home,
My God, my heaven, my all.  [Chorus]

4.
There shall I bathe my weary soul
In seas of heavenly rest,
And not a wave of trouble roll 
Across my peaceful breast.  [Chorus]
