####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Hark!  the song of Jubilee;
Loud as mighty thunders roar,
Or the fulness of the sea
When it breaks upon the shore;
Hallelujah!  'tis the Lord!
Lo, he comes on earth to reign;
Hallelujah!  let the word
Echo round the earth and main.

2.
Hallelujah!  hark!  the sound
Rises joyful to the skies;
From above, beneath, around,
Wake creation's harmonies:
See Jehovah's banner furl'd,
Sheath'd his sword:  he speaks, 'tis done;
Hallelujah!  let the word
Echo around the earth and main.

3.
He shall reign from pole to pole
With supreme, unbounded sway;
He shall reign, when like a scroll
Yonder heav'ns have pass'd away:
Then beneath his iron rod,
Man's last enemy shall fall;
Hallelujah!  to our God,
Lo, he comes to conquer all.
