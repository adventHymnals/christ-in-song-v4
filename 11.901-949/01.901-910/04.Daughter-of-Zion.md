```txt
1.
Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness;
Awake, for thy foes shall oppress thee no more.
Bright, o'er thy hills, dawns the day star of gladness,
Arise, for the night of thy sorrow is o'er.

Chorus:
Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness;
Awake, for thy foes shall oppress thee no more.

2.
 Strong were thy foes; but the arm that subdued them,
And scattered their legions, was mightier far;
They fled like the chaff from the scourge that pursued them;
In vain were their steeds and their chariots of war.  [Chorus]

3.
Daughter of Zion, the power that hath saved thee,
Extolled with the harp and the timbrel shall be;
Shout:  for the foe is destroyed that enslaved thee;
Th' oppressor is vanquished, and Zion is free.  [Chorus]
