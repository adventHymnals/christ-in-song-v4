        Christ in Song 905. Jordan's Stormy Banks. On Jordan's stormy banks I stand, And cast a wishful eye To Canaan's fair and happy land, Where my possessions lie. Chorus: We will rest in the fair and happy land, Just across on the evergreen shore; Sing the song of Moses and the Lamb by and by, And dwell with Jesus evermore.

1.
On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan's fair and happy land,
Where my possessions lie.

Chorus:
We will rest in the fair and happy land,
Just across on the evergreen shore;
Sing the song of Moses and the Lamb by and by,
And dwell with Jesus evermore.

2.
O'er all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day,
There Christ, the Sun, forever reigns,
And scatters night away.  [Chorus]

3.
When shall I reach that happy place,
And be forever blest?
When shall I see my Father's face,
And in his kingdom rest?  [Chorus]

4.
Fill'd with delight, my raptured soul
Would here no longer stay;
Tho' Jordan's waves around me roll,
Fearless I'd launch away.  [Chorus]
