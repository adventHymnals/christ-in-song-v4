####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
"Land ahead!"  its fruits are waving
O'er the hills of fadeless green,
And the living waters laving
Shores where heav'nly forms are seen.

Chorus:
Rock and storms I'll fear no more,
When on that eternal shore;
I am safe within the vail!

2.
Onward bark!  the cape I'm rounding;
See the blessed wave their hands!
Hear the harps of God resounding
From the bright immortal band!  [Chorus]

3.
Now we're safe from all temptation,
All the storms of life are past
Praise the Rock of our salvation,
We are safe at home at last!  [Chorus]
