####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
On the mountain top appearing,
Lo!  the sacred herald stands,
Welcome news to Zion bearing
Zion long in hostile lands:
Mourning captive!  Mourning captive!
God himself shall loose thy hands.

2.
Has thy night been long and mournful?
Have thy friends unfaithful proved?
Have thy foes been proud and scornful,
By thy sighs and tears unmoved?
Cease thy mourning; Cease thy mourning;
Zion still is well belov'd.

3.
God, thy God will now restore thee;
He himself appears thy friend;
All thy foes shall flee before thee;
Here their boasts and triumphs end:
Great deliver'ance, Great deliv'rance
Zion's king will surely send.
