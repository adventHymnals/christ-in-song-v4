####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The glories of that heav'nly land
I've ofttimes felt before;
But what I feel is just a taste,
And makes me long for more,
And makes me long for more.

2.
Had I the pinious of a dove,
I'd fly and be at rest;
Then would I go to Christ, my love,
And dwell among the blest,
And dwell among the blest.

3.
But Patience bids us wait awhile!
The crown's for them that fight;
The prize for those that win the race
By faith, and not by sight,
By faith, and not by sight.
