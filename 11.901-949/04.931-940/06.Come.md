#### Advent Hymnals
## 936. COME
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Christ is coming!  let creation
Bid her groans and travails cease;
Let the glorious proclamation
Hope restore and faith increase;
Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!
Come, thou blessed Prince of Peace!

2.
Earth can now but tell the story
Of thy bitter cross and pain;
She shall soon behold thy glory,
When thou comest back to reign;
Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!
Let each heart repeat the strain.

3.
Long thy exiles have been pining,
Far from rest, and home, and thee;
But, in heav'nly vesture shining,
Soon they shall thy glory see;
Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!
Hast the joyous jubilee.

4.
With that "blessed hope" before us,
Let no harp remain unstrung;
Let the mighty advent chorus
Onward roll, from tongue to tongue;
Christ is coming!  Christ is coming!
Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
