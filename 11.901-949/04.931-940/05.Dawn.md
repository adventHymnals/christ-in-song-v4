1.
O'er the distant mountain breaking,
Comes the red'ning dawn of day;
Rise, my soul, from sleep awaking,
Rise, and sing, and watch, and pray;
'Tis the Saviour  'Tis the Saviour
On his bright returning way.

2.
O thou long-expected!  weary
Waits my anxious soul for thee;
Life is dark, and earth is dreary
Where thy  light I do not see:
O my Saviour, O my Saviour,
When wilt thou return to me?

3.
Long, too long, in sin and sadness,
Far away from thee I pine;
When, O when shall I the gladness 
Of thy Spirit feel in mine?
O my Saviour, O my Saviour,
When shall I be wholly thine?

4.
Nearer is my soul's salvation,
Spent the night, the day at hand;
Keep me in my lowly station,
Watching for thee, till I stand,
O my Saviour, O my Saviour,
In thy bright and promised land.

5.
With my lamp well-trimm'd and burning,
Swift to hear, and slow to roam,
Watching for thy glad returning
To restore me to my home;
Come, my Saviour, Come, my Saviour,
O my Saviour, quickly come!
