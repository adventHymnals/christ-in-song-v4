```txt
1.
Hark!  that shout of rapture high,
Bursting forth from yonder cloud;
Jesus comes, thro' the sky,
Angels tell their joy aloud,
Angels tell their joy aloud.

2.
Hark!  the trumpet's awful voice
Sounds abroad o'er sea and land;
Let his people now rejoice;
Their redemption is at hand,
Their redemption is at hand.

3.
See, the Lord appears in view;
Heav'n and earth before him fly;
Rise, ye saints, he comes for you;
Rise, to meet him in the sky,
Rise, to meet him in the sky.

4.
Go and dwell with him above,
Where no foe can e'er molest;
Happy in the Saviour's love,
Ever blessing, ever blest,
Ever blessing, ever blest.
