    1.
    Come, children, hail the Prince of Peace
    Obey the Saviour's call;
    Come, seek His face and taste His grace,
    And crown Him Lord of all.

    Chorus:
    In the dewy time of youth, let us come,
    Before the brown leaves fall;
    He will guide us with His truth, let us come,
    And crown Him Lord of all.

    2.
    Ye lambs of Christ, your tribute bring,
    Ye children, great and small;
    Hosanna sing to Christ your King,
    And crown Him Lord of all.  [Chorus]

    3.
    This Jesus will your sins forgive,
    O haste!  before Him fall;
    For you He died, that you might live
    To crown Him Lord of all.  [Chorus]
