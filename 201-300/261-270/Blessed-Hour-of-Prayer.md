    1.
    'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,
    And we gather to Jesus, our Saviour and Friend;
    If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,
    What a balm for the weary!  O how sweet to be there!

    Chorus:  Blessed hour of prayer,
    Blessed hour of prayer,
    What a balm for the weary!
    O how sweet to be there!

    2.
    'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Saviour draws near,
    With a tender compassion His children to hear;
    When He tells us we may cast at His feet ev'ry care,
    What a balm for the weary!  O how sweet to be there!  [Chorus]

    3.
    'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried
    To the Saviour who loves them their sorrows confide;
    With a sympathizing heart He removes ev'ry care;
    What a balm for the weary!  O how sweet to be there!  [Chorus]

    4.
    At the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe
    That the blessings we're needing we'll surely receive,
    In the fulness of this trust we shall lose ev'ry care;
    What a balm for the weary!  O how sweet to be there!  [Chorus]
