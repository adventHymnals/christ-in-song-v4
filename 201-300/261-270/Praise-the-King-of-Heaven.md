    1.
    Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven,
    To His feet thy tribute bring;
    Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
    Who like thee His praise should sing?
    Praise Him!  praise Him!
    Praise Him!  praise Him!
    Praise the everlasting King!

    2.
    Praise, Him for His grace and favor
    To our fathers in distress;
    Praise Him, still the same forever,
    Slow to chide, and swift to blest;
    Praise Him!  praise Him!
    Praise Him!  praise Him!
    Praise the high eternal One!

    3.
    Frail as summer's flow'r we flourish,
    Blows the wind, and it is gone;
    But, while mortals rise and perish,
    God endures unchanging on.
    Praise Him!  praise Him!
    Praise Him!  praise Him!
    Praise the high eternal One!

    4.
    Angels, help us to adore Him;
    Ye behold Him face to face;
    Sun and moon, bow down before Him,
    Dwellers all in time and space,
    Praise Him!  praise Him!
    Praise Him!  praise Him!  
    Praise with us the God of grace!
