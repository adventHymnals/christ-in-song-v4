    1.
    Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious,
    See the Man of Sorrows now;
    From the fight returned victorious,
    Ev'ry knee to Him shall bow;
    Crown Him, crown Him, crown Him, crown Him,
    Crowns become the victor's brow.

    2.
    Crown the Saviour, angels crown Him,
    Rich the trophies Jesus brings;
    On the seat of pow'r enthrone Him,
    While the vault of heaven rings;
    Crown Him, crown Him, crown Him, crown Him, 
    Crown the Saviour King of kings.

    3.
    Sinners in derision crowned Him,
    Mocking thus the Saviour's claim;
    Saints and angels crowd around Him,
    Own His title, praise His name;
    Crown Him, crown Him, crown Him, crown Him,
    Spread abroad the victor's fame.

    4.
    Hark!  those bursts of acclamation;
    Hark!  those loud triumphant chords;
    Jesus takes the highest station;
    Oh, what joy the sight affords!
    Crown Him, crown Him, crown Him, crown Him,
    King of kings, and Lord of lords.
