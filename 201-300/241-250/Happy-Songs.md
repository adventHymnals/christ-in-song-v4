    1.
    Long ago the children sang a song
    Of praise to Jesus as he rode along:
    "Hosanna!  Hosanna!  
    Hosanna in the highest!"

    Chorus:
    Happy songs, happy songs,
    Let the children sing their happy, happy songs;
    Happy songs, happy songs,
    Jesus loves to hear our songs.

    2.
    As of old he loves to hear us sing
    Our songs of praise to him, our heav'nly King:
    "Hosanna!  Hosanna!  
    Hosanna in the highest!'  [Chorus]

    3.
    By and by we'll sing a sweeter song
    With all the saved, a glad and glorious throng:
    "Hosanna!  Hosanna!
    Hosanna in the highest!"  [Chorus]
