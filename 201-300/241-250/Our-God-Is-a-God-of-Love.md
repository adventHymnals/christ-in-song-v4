    1.
    Do you know what the dewdrops say,
    As they sparkle at break of day?
    It is "Love, love, love,
    Our God is a God of love;"
    It is "Love, love, love,
    Our God is a God of love."

    2.
    Do you know what the sunbeams bright,
    Are singing from morning till night?
    It is "love, love, love,
    Our God is a God of love;"
    It is "Love, love, love,
    Our God is a God of love."

    3.
    Do you know what the soft rain tells,
    As it tinkles like fairy bells?
    It is "love, love, love,
    Our God is a God of love;"
    It is "Love, love, love,
    Our God is a God of love."

    4.
    Do you know what the winds proclaim,
    As they rustle the golden grain?
    It is "love, love, love,
    Our God is a God of love;"
    It is "Love, love, love,
    Our God is a God of love."
