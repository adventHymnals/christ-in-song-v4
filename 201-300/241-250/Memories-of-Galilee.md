    1.
    Each cooing dove and sighing bough
    That makes the eve so blest to me,
    Has something far diviner now,
    It bears me back to Galilee.

    Chorus:  
    O Galilee, sweet Galilee,
    Where Jesus loved so much to be,
    O Galilee, blue Galilee,
    Come, sing thy song again to me.

    2.
    Each flow'ry glen and mossy dell,
    Where happy birds in song agree,
    Thro' sunny morn the praises tell,
    Of sight and sounds in Galilee.  [Chorus]

    3.
    And when I read the thrilling lore,
    Of him who walk'd upon the sea,
    I long, oh, how I long once more,
    To follow him in Galilee.  [Chorus]
