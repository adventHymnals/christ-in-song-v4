    1.
    In joyful high and holy lays
    My soul her grateful voice would raise;
    But who can sing the worthy praise
    Of the wonderful love of Jesus?

    Refrain:
    Wonderful love!  wonderful love!
    Wonderful love of Jesus!
    Wonderful love!  wonderful love!
    Wonderful love of Jesus!

    2.
    A joy by day, a peace by night,
    In storms a calm, in darkness light,
    In pain a balm, in weakness might,
    Is the wonderful love of Jesus.  [Refrain]

    3.
    My hope for pardon when I call,
    My trust for lifting when I fall;
    In life, in death, my all in all,
    Is the wonderful love of Jesus.  [Refrain]
