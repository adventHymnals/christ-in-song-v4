    1.
    The dove of peace sings in my heart,
    "In strife and war thou hast no part;
    Thy place among the hosts of wrong
    Is but to echo love's sweet song."

    Refrain:
    The dove of peace sings in my soul,
    "Thy Saviour's blood doth make thee whole;"
    The Spirit's voice, like wooing dove,
    Sings of my Saviour's deathless love.

    2.
    The dove of peace hath radiant wings,
    And light and melody he brings;
    He tells of my soon-coming King,
    Of praises that the angels sing.  [Refrain]

    3.
    O gentle voice of Jesus' love!
    It links the life to heav'n above,
    And thro' all sorrow and all wrong
    O'erflows the soul with tender song.  [Refrain]

    4.
    The dove of peace shall ne'er depart,
    But keep his home within my heart.
    E'en when I rise to worlds above,
    I'll hear the singing of the dove.  [Refrain]

    5.
    O wouldst thou hear the dove within?
    Let Jesus cleanse thy heart from sin:
    Then in sweet measures from above
    Thou'lt hear the music of his love.  [Refrain]
