    1.
    He will mention them no more forever,
    My sins are all taken away;
    For his royal promise changes never,
    My sins are all taken away.

    Chorus:
    They are all taken away,
    They are all taken away;
    He will mention them no more forever;
    Praise the Lord!  sing it all day.
    They are all taken away,
    They are all taken away;
    I am resting in the great Peace Giver, 
    My sins are all taken away.

    2.
    Since I came by faith to Calv'ry's mountain,
    My sins are all taken away;
    Thro' the cleansing pow'r of that blest Fountain,
    My sins are all taken away.  [Chorus]

    3.
    At the bottom of the sea they're lying,
    My sins are all taken away;
    Now the pow'rs of sin and self denying,
    My sins are all taken away.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Once the "carnal mind" was all my pleasure,
    My sins are all taken away;
    Now the word of God is my chief treasure,
    My sins are all taken away.  [Chorus]

    5.
    Doubt can never stay where Faith is singing,
    "My sins are all taken away;"
    "Praise the Lord" within my heart is ringing,
    My sins are all taken away.  [Chorus]
