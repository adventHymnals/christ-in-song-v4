    1.
    Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight,
    Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm;
    In celestial like strains it unceasingly falls
    O'er my soul like an infinite calm.

    Chorus:
    Peace!  peace!  wonderful peace,
    Coming down from the Father above;
    Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray,
    In fathomless billows of love.

    2.
    What a treasure I have in this wonderful peace,
    Buried deep in my innermost soul;
    So secure that no power can mine it away,
    While the years of eternity roll!  [Chorus]

    3.
    I am resting to-night in this wonderful peace,
    Resting sweetly in Jesus' control;
    I am kept from all danger by night and by day,
    And his glory is flooding my soul.  [Chorus]

    4.
    I believe when I rise to that city of peace,
    Where the Author of peace I shall see,
    That one strain of the song which the ransomed will sing,
    In that heavenly kingdom will be,  [Chorus]

    5.
    Weary soul, without gladness or comfort or rest,
    Passing down the rough pathway of time!
    Make the Saviour your friend ere the shadows grow dark;
    O accept of this peace so sublime.  [Chorus]
