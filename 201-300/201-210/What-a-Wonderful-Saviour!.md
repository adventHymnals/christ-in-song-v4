    1.
    Christ has for sin atonement made,
    What a wonderful Saviour!
    We are redeemed!  the price is paid!
    What a wonderful Saviour!

    Chorus:
    What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Jesus!
    What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord!

    2.
    I praise Him for the cleansing blood,
    What a wonderful Saviour!
    That reconciled my soul to God;
    What a wonderful Saviour!  [Chorus]

    3.
    He cleansed my heart from all its sin,
    What a wonderful Saviour!
    And now He reigns and rules therein;
    What a wonderful Saviour!  [Chorus]

    4.
    He walks beside me all the way,
    What a wonderful Saviour!
    And keeps me faithful day by day;
    What a wonderful Saviour!  [Chorus]

    5.
    He gives me overcoming pow'r,
    What a wonderful Saviour!
    And triumph in each trying hour;
    What a wonderful Saviour!  [Chorus]

    6.
    To Him I've given all my heart,
    What a wonderful Saviour!
    The world shall never share a part;
    What a wonderful Saviour!  [Chorus]
