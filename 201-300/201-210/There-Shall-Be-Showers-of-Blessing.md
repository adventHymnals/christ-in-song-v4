    1.
    "There shall be showers of blessing:"
    This is the promise of love;
    There shall be seasons refreshing,
    Sent from the Saviour above.

    Chorus:
    Showers, showers of blessing,
    Showers of blessing we need;
    Mercy drops round us are falling,
    But for the showers we plead.

    2.
    "There shall be showers of blessing"
    Precious reviving again;
    Over the hills and the valleys,
    Sound of abundance of rain.  [Chorus]

    3.
    "There shall be showers of blessing:"
    Send them upon us, O Lord;
    Grant to us now a refreshing,
    Come, and now honor Thy Word.  [Chorus]

    4.
    "There shall be showers of blessing;"
    Oh, that today they might fall,
    Now as to God we're confessing,
    Now as on Jesus we call!  [Chorus]
