    1.
    My hope is built on nothing less
    Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
    I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
    But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

    Refrain:
    On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
    All other ground is sinking sand,
    All other ground is sinking sand.

    2.
    When darkness seems to veil his face,
    I rest on his unchanging grace;
    In ev'ry high and stormy gale,
    My anchor holds within the vail.  [Refrain]

    3.
    His oath, his covenant, and blood,
    Support me in the whelming flood;
    When all around my soul gives way,
    He then is all my hope and stay.  [Refrain]

    4.
    When he shall come with trumpet sound,
    O may I then in him be found;
    Clad in his righteousness alone,
    Faultless to stand before the throne.  [Refrain]
