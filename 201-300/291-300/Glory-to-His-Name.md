    1.
    Down at the cross where my Saviour died,
    Down where for cleansing from sin I cried,
    There to my heart was the blood applied.
    Glory to his name.

    Chorus:
    Glory to his name,
    Glory to his name.
    There to my heart was the blood applied,
    Glory to his name.

    2.
    I am so wondrously saved from sin,
    Jesus so sweetly abides within,
    There at the cross where he took me in,
    Glory to his name.  [Chorus]

    3.
    O precious Fountain that saves from sin!
    I am so glad I have entered in,
    There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean.
    Glory to his name.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Come to this Fountain so rich and sweet,
    Cast thy poor soul at the Saviour's feet,
    Plunge in today and be made complete, 
    Glory to his name.  [Chorus]
