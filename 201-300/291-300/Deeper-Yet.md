    1.
    In the blood from the cross
    I have been wash'd from sin;
    But to be free from dross
    Still I would enter in.

    Chorus:
    Deeper, yet, deeper yet,
    Into the crimson flood;
    Deeper yet, deeper yet,
    Under the precious blood.

    2.
    Day by day, hour by hour
    Blessings are sent to me;
    But for more of His pow'r
    Ever my pray'r shall be.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Near to Christ I would live,
    Following Him each day;
    What I ask He will give,
    So then with faith I pray.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Now I have peace, sweet peace,
    While in this world of sin;
    But to pray I'll not cease
    Till I am pure within.  [Chorus]
