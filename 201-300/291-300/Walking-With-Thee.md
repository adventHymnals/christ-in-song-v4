    1.
    Walking with thee, my God,
    Saviour benign,
    Daily confer on me
    Converse divine;
    Jesus, in thee restores,
    Brother, and blessed Lord,
    Let it be mine,
    Let it be mine.

    2.
    Walking with thee, my God,
    Like as a child
    Leans on his father's strength,
    Crossing the wild.
    And by the way is taught
    Lessons of holy tho't,
    Faith undefiled,
    Faith undefiled.

    3.
    Walking with thee, my God,
    Humbly with thee;
    Yet from all care and fear
    Lovingly free.
    E'en as a friend with friend,
    Chee'rd to the journey's end,
    Walking with thee,
    Walking with thee.
