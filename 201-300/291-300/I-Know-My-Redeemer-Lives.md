    1.
    "I know that my Redeemer lives,"
    And ever prays for me;
    A token of His love He gives,
    A pledge of liberty.

    2.
    He lives all glorious in the sky,
    He lives who once was dead;
    He lives exalted there on high,
    My everlasting Head.

    3.
    He lives, triumphant o'er the grave,
    And while He lives I'll sing;
    He lives eternally to save,
    My Prophet, Priest and King.

    4.
    He lives, my mansion to prepare,
    My Jesus, still the same;
    He lives to bring me safely there,
    All glory to His name.
