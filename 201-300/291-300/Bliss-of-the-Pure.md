    1.
    O bliss of the pure ones!
    O bliss of the free!
    I've plung'd in the fountain once open'd for me!
    O'er sin and uncleanness exulting I stand,
    And point to the nailprints in his holy hands,
    And point to the nailprints in his holy hands.

    2.
    O bliss of the sav'd ones!
    Christ Jesus is mine!
    No more condemnation; no longer I pine.
    In conscious salvation I sing of his grace
    Who lifted upon me the smiles of his face,
    Who lifted upon me the smiles of his face.

    3.
    O bliss of the glad ones!
    O bliss of the pure!
    No wound hath the spirit that he can not cure;
    No head bow'd with sorrow but sweetly may rest,
    No tears but may vanish on his loving breast,
    No tears but may vanish on his loving breast.

    4.
    O Crucified Jesus!  of thee will I sing,
    My blessed Redeemer, my God and my King;
    My soul fill'd with rapture, shall shout o'er the grave;
    In him will I triumph, the "Mighty to Save!"  
    In him will I triumph, the "Mighty to Save!"
