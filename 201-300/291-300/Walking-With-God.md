    1.
    O let me walk with thee, my God,
    As Enoch walked in days of old;
    Place thou my trembling hand in thine,
    And sweet communion with me hold;
    E'en tho' the path I May not see,
    Yet, Jesus, let me walk with thee.

    2.
    I can not, dare not walk alone;
    The tempest rages in the sky;
    A thousand snares beset my feet,
    A thousand foes are lurking nigh;
    Still thou the raging of the sea;
    O Master, let me walk with thee.

    3.
    If I may rest my hand in thine,
    I'll count the joys of earth but loss,
    And firmly, bravely journey on;
    I'll bear the banner of the cross
    Till Zion's glorious gates I see:
    Yet, Saviour, let me walk with thee.
