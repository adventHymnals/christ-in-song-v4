[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ovxadgggxMgJOIMJejIRoKPodMyVClNs/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    More love to thee, O Christ!
    More love to thee;
    Hear thou the pray'r I make
    On bended knee.
    This is my earnest plea,
    More love, O Christ, to thee,
    More love to thee!
    More love to thee!

    2.
    Once earthly joy I craved,
    Sought peace and rest;
    Now thee alone I seek,
    Give what is best.
    This all my pray'r shall be,
    More love, O Christ, to thee,
    More love to thee!
    More love to thee!

    3.
    Let sorrow do its work,
    Send grief or pain;
    Sweet are thy messengers,
    Sweet their refrain,
    When they can sing with me,
    More love, O Christ, to thee,
    More love to thee!
    More love to thee!

    3.
    Then shall my latest breath,
    Whisper thy praise;
    This be the parting cry
    My heart shall raise,
    This still its pray'r shall be:
    More love, O Christ, to thee,
    More love to thee!
    More love to thee!
