    1.
    Jesus, I will follow thee,
    For I hear thee calling me;
    Loving, trusting, glad I come,
    To let thee lead me home.

    Chorus:
    I will follow thee,
    I will follow thee, 
    I will follow thee
    Wherever thou dost lead.

    2.
    Little eyes might lose the way,
    Little feet might go astray;
    I might weak and weary be,
    But thou art strong for me.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Grief and want may be my foes,
    Foolish sins my way oppose;
    Full of courage I will be,
    Whene'er I follow thee.  [Chorus]
