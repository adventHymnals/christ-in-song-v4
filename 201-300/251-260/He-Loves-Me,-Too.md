    1.
    God sees the little sparrow fall
    It meets his tender view;
    If God so loves the little birds,
    I know he loves me, too.

    Chorus:
    He loves me, too, he loves me, too,
    I know he loves me, too;
    Because he loves the little things, 
    I know he loves me, too.

    2.
    He paints the lily of the field,
    Perfumes each lily bell;
    If he so loves the little flow'rs,
    I know he loves me well.  [Chorus]

    3.
    God made the little birds and flowr's,
    And all things large and small;
    He'll not forget his little ones,
    I know he loves them all.  [Chorus]
