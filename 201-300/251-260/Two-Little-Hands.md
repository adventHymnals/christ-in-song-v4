[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qnTcUvZtFRsSCiTZomRXUCoEZz%2DJZYnR/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I've two little hands to work for Jesus,
    One little tongue his praise to tell,
    Two little ears to hear his counsel,
    One little voice a song to swell.

    Chorus:
    Lord, we come, Lord, we come,
    In our childhood's early morning,
    Lord, we come, Lord, we come,
    Come to learn of thee.

    2.
    I've two little feet to tread the pathway
    Up to the heav'nly courts above;
    Two little eyes to read the Bible,
    Telling of Jesus' wondrous love.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I've one little heart to give to Jesus,
    One little soul for him to save,
    One little life for his dear service,
    One little self that he must have.  [Chorus]
