[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo3ZLo5LwA65Ih%2DHbCNG2wWEwVq1CJLZ/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Praise ye Jehovah's name,
    Praise thro' His courts proclaim,
    Rise and adore,
    High 'er the heav'ns above,
    Sounds His great acts of love,
    While His rich grace we prove,
    Vast as His pow'r.

    2.
    Now let the trumpet raise
    Sounds of triumphant praise,
    Wide as His fame
    There let the harp be found;
    Organs of solemn sound,
    Roll your deep notes around,
    Filled with His name.

    3.
    While His high praise you sing,
    Shake ev'ry sounding string;
    Sweet the accord!
    He vital breath bestows;
    Let ev'ry breath that flows,
    His noble fame disclose;
    Praise ye the Lord.
