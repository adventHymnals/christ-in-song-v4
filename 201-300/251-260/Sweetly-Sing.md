[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rGbdNpVsNxf_RiLRF8Qe6jmAZyF85oaA/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    Sweetly sing, sweetly sing,
    Praises to our heav'nly King;
    Let us raise, let us raise
    High our notes of praise;
    Praise to Him whose name is Love,
    Praise to Him who reigns above;
    Raise your songs, raise your songs,
    Now with thankful tongues.

    2.
    Angels bright, angels bright,
    Rob'd in garments pure and white,
    Chant his praise, chant his praise
    In melodious lays;
    But from that bright, happy throng,
    Ne'er can come this sweetest song,
    "Pard'ning love, pard'ning love,
    Brought us here above."

    3.
    Far away, far away,
    We in sin's dark valley lay,
    Jesus came, Jesus came,
    Blessed be his name;
    He redeem'd us by his grace,
    Then prepar'd in heav'n a place
    To receive, to receive,
    All who will believe.
