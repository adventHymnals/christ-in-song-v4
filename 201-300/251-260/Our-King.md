    1.
    Our sweetest songs of gladness,
    On this delightful day,
    We bring to praise the Saviour,
    Who is the Life, the Way.

    Chorus:
    We sing, we sing
    The praises of our King,
    We sing, we sing
    The glory of our King.

    2.
    He lov'd the little children,
    When he was here below,
    And tho' he's up in heaven,
    He loves us yet we know.  [Chorus]

    3.
    We love to sing his praises
    And hear the stories told,
    Of him when he was dwelling
    In Galilee of old.  [Chorus]

    4.
    O Saviour, blessed Saviour,
    We kneel, before thy throne,
    And ask that thou wilt help us
    To live for thee alone.  [Chorus]
