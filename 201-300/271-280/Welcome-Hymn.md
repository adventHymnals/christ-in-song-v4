    1.
    Welcome!  thrice welcome!
    Ye loyal host of God,
    Welcome!  thrice welcome!
    From near and from abroad;
    Tho' changing years pass swiftly by,
    Our cause is still the same,
    And thus we gladly greet you in
    Our Master's conq'ring Name.

    Chorus:
    Welcome!  thrice welcome 
    to homes and hearts and love;
    Welcome!  thrice welcome!
    And blessings from above.

    2.
    Welcome!  thrice welcome!
    Believers in the Lord;
    Welcome!  thrice welcome!
    Upholders of His word;
    We meet our Saviour's name to praise,
    To learn what He requires,
    And by His Spirit's help resolve
    To follow His desires.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Welcome!  thrice welcome!
    Be steadfast in the right,
    Welcome!  thrice welcome!
    Till faith is lost in sight;
    And when our battles all are won
    We'll join the blessed throng,
    Then God will welcome us and we
    Will hear heav'ns welcome song.  [Chorus]
