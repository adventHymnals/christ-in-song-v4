    1.
    List to the chime, 'tis meeting time,
    The joyous bells are ringing;
    This is the day, they seem to say,
    To meet for pray'r and singing.

    Chorus:
    Ring, ring, ring, ring,
    Ring, ye joyous bells;
    Ring, ring, ring, ring,
    Ring, ye joyous bells.

    2.
    Join with the throng and swell the song,
    The Saviour's love confessing;
    Offer a pray'r that you may share
    The fulness of His blessing.

    Chorus:
    Ring, ring, ring, ring, 
    Ring, ye joyous bells;
    Ring, ring, ring, ring, 
    Ring, ye joyous bells.

    3.
    Learn of the way, and then obey
    The truth so kindly given;
    Thus, may you say, each closing day;
    I'm nearer home and heaven.

    Chorus:
    On time, on time,
    Answer to the chime;
    On time, on time,
    Always here on time.
