    1.
    Children singing, sweet bells ringing!
    Welcome, welcome, happy day!
    Pray'rs of thousands now are winging
    Up to heav'n their silent way.

    Chorus:
    Welcome, welcome, joyous welcome;
    Teachers, scholars, welcome here!

    2.
    'Tis an hour of happy meeting,
    We have met for praise and pray'r;
    But the hour is short and fleeting;
    This is why we're early here.  [Chorus]

    3.
    We'll not keep our teachers waiting,
    While we tarry by the way,
    Nor disturb the school reciting,
    'Tis the holy Sabbath day.  [Chorus]
