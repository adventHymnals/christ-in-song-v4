    1.
    Strains of music often greet me,
    As I join the busy throng,
    But there's nothing half so pleasant,
    As the holy Sabbath song.

    Chorus:
    No fear of ill, no fear or wrong,
    While I can sing my Sabbath song:
    My Sabbath song, my Sabbath song,
    I love to sing my Sabbath song.

    2.
    'Tis a song of love and mercy,
    Speaking peace to all mankind,
    Telling sinners poor and needy,
    Where the Saviour they may find.  [Chorus]

    3.
    While I love, O may I ever
    Love the holy Sabbath song,
    And in yonder home eternal, 
    Sing it with the blood bought throng.  [Chorus]
