[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lFYrOmFfvA1RmzzK7OfIwh4pAggtW44P/edit?mode=html)



    O sing unto the Lord a new song;
    for he hath done marv'lous things;
    his right hand, and his holy arm
    hath gotten him the victory.

    The Lord hath made known his salvation:
    his righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the heathen.
    He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel.
    All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

    Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth,
    make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise.
    Sing unto the Lord with the harp;
    with the harp and the voice of a psalm.

    With trumpets and sound of cornet
    make a joyful noise before the Lord, the King.
    Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
    the world and they that dwell therein.

    Let the floods clap their hands; let the hills be joyful together before the Lord;
    for he cometh to judge the earth:
    with righteousness shall he judge the world,
    and the people with equity.
