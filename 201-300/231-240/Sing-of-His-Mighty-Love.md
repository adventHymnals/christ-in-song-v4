    1.
    Oh, bliss of the purified!  bliss of the free!
    I plunge in the crimson tide open for me!
    O'er sin and uncleanness exulting I stand,
    And point to the print of the nails in His hand.

    Chorus:
    Oh, sing of His mighty love,
    Sing of His mighty love,
    Sing of His mighty love
    Mighty to save!

    2.
    Oh, bliss of the purified!  Jesus is mine,
    In dread condemnation, no longer I pine;
    In conscious salvation I sing of His grace,
    Who lifted upon me the smile of His face!  [Chorus]

    3.
    Oh, bliss of the purified!  bliss of the pure!
    No wound hath the soul that His blood cannot cure;
    No head sorrow bowed but may sweetly find rest,
    No tears but may vanish on His loving breast.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Oh, Jesus, the Crucified!  Thee will I sing!
    My blessed redeemer!  my God and my King! 
    My soul filled with rapture, shall shout o'er the grave,
    And triumph at death in the "Mighty to Save!"  [Chorus]
