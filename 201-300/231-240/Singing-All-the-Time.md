    1.
    I feel like singing all the time,
    My tears are wiped away;
    For Jesus is a friend of mine,
    I'll serve him ev'ry day.

    Chorus:
    I'm singing, singing,
    Singing all the time;
    Singing, singing, 
    singing all the time.

    2.
    When on the cross my Lord I saw,
    Nail'd there by sins of mine;
    Fast fell the burning tears; 
    but now I'm singing all the time.  [Chorus]

    3.
    When fierce temptations try my heart,
    I sing, Jesus is mine;
    And tho; the tears at times may start,
    I'm singing all the time.  [Chorus]

    4.
    The wondrous story of the Lamb,
    Tell with that voice of thine;
    Till others with the glad new song,
    Go singing all the time.  [Chorus]
