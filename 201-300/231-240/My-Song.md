    1.
    O Jesus my Redeemer,
    Thou art my joy and song,
    My Saviour and my solace
    When griefs around me throng.

    Chorus:
    O Jesus my Redeemer,
    My song shall be of Thee;
    No other friend so constant,
    No other friend so dear to me.

    2.
    Thou art my hope and comfort,
    Thro' all the weary years,
    When shadows dark surround me,
    When fall the bitter tears.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I trust in Thee, my Saviour, 
    My faithful friend and guide,
    For Thou to me art dearer
    Than all on earth beside.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Thou art my soul's rejoicing
    While in this world of sin,
    Thou shalt be my rejoicing
    The heav'nly gates within.  [Chorus]
