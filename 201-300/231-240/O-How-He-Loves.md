    1.
    One there is above all others,
    O how He loves!
    His is love beyond a brother's,
    O how He loves!
    Earthly friends may fail or leave us,
    One day soothe, the next day grieve us;
    But this Friend will ne'er deceive us,
    O how He loves!

    2.
    'Tis eternal life to know Him,
    O how He loves!
    Think, O think how much we owe Him,
    O how He loves!
    With His precious blood He bought us,
    In the wilderness He sought us,
    To His fold He safely brought us,
    O how He loves!

    3.
    Blessed Jesus!  would you know Him,
    O how He loves!
    Give yourselves entirely to Him,
    O how He loves!
    Leave the past for bright tomorrow,
    From His word now courage borrow,
    Jesus carries all your sorrow, 
    O how He loves!

    4.
    Thro' His name we are forgiven,
    O how He loves!
    Backward shall our foes be driven,
    O how He loves!
    Best of blessings He'll provide us,
    Naught but good shall e'er betide us,
    Safe to glory He will guide us,
    O how He loves!
