    1.
    I have a song I love to sing,
    Since I have been redeem'd;
    Of my Redeemer, my Saviour, King,
    Since I have been redeem'd.

    Chorus:
    Since I have been redeem'd,
    Since I have been redeem'd, 
    I will glory in His name;
    Since I have been redeem'd,
    I will glory in my Saviour's name.

    2.
    I have a Christ that satisfies,
    Since I have been redeem'd;
    To do His will my highest prize,
    Since I have been redeem'd.  [Chorus]

    3.
    I have a witness bright and clear,
    Since I have been redeem'd;
    Dispelling ev'ry doubt and fear,
    Since I have been redeem'd.  [Chorus]

    4.
    I have a home prepared for me,
    Since I have been redeem'd;
    Where I shall dwell eternally,
    Since I have been redeem'd.  [Chorus]
