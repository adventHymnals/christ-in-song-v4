    1.
    There is sunlight on the hilltop,
    There is sunlight on the sea,
    And the golden beams are sleeping,
    On the soft and verdant lea;
    But a richer light is filling
    All the chambers of my heart;
    For thou dwellest there my Saviour,
    And 'tis sunlight where thou art.

    Refrain:
    O the sunlight!  beautiful sunlight!
    O the sunlight in the heart!
    Jesus' smile can banish sadness;
    It is sunlight in the heart.

    2.
    In the dust I leave my sadness,
    As the garb of other days,
    For thou robest me with gladness,
    And thou fillest me with praise;
    And to that bright home of glory
    Which thy love hath won for me,
    In my heart and mind ascending,
    My glad spirit follows thee.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Loving Saviour, thou hast bought me,
    And my life, my all, is thine;
    Let the lamp thy love hath lighted
    To thy praise and glory shine;
    And to that bright home of glory
    Which thy love hath won for me,
    In my heart and mind ascending,
    My glad spirit follows thee. [Refrain]
