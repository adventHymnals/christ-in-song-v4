    1.
    Since Christ my soul from sin set free,
    This world has been a heav'n to me;
    And 'mid earth's sorrow and its woe,
    'Tis heav'n my Jesus here to know.

    Chorus:
    O hallelujah!  yes, 'tis heav'n,
    'Tis heav'n to know my sins forgiv'n;
    On land or sea, what matters where?
    Where Jesus is, 'tis heaven there.

    2.
    Once heaven seemed a far-off place,
    Till Jesus showed His smiling face;
    Now 'tis begun within my soul,
    To last while endless ages roll.  [Chorus]

    3.
    What matters where on earth we dwell?
    On mountain top, or in the dell,
    In cottage, or a mansion fair,
    Where Jesus is, 'tis heaven there.  [Chorus]
