    1.
    Praise Him!  praise Him!  Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
    Sing, O earth His wonderful love proclaim!
    Hail Him!  hail Him!  highest archangels in glory;
    Strength and honor give to His holy name!
    Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children,
    In His arms He carries them all day long;
    Praise Him!  praise Him!  tell of His excellent greatness;
    Praise Him!  praise Him ever in joyful song!

    2.
    Praise Him!  praise Him!  Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
    For our sins He suffered, and bled and died;
    He our Rock, our hope of eternal salvation,
    Hail Him!  hail Him!  Jesus, the crucified.
    Sound His praises!  Jesus who bore our sorrows,
    Love unbounded, wonderful, deep and strong;
    Praise Him!  praise Him!  tell of His excellent greatness;
    Praise Him!  praise Him ever in joyful song!

    3.
    Praise Him!  praise Him!  Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
    Heav'nly portals, loud with hosannas ring!
    Jesus, Saviour, reigneth forever and ever:
    Crown Him!  crown Him!  Prophet, and Priest, and King!
    Christ is coming over the world victorious,
    Pow'r and glory unto the Lord belong;
    Praise Him!  praise him!  tell of His excellent greatness;
    Praise Him!  praise Him ever in joyful song!
