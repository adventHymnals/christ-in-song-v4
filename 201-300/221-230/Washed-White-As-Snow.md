    1.
    Tho' my sins were once like crimson red,
    To the healing stream my feet were led;
    In the precious blood my Saviour shed
    He washed me white as snow.

    Chorus:
    O my joyful song henceforth shall be,
    " 'Tis the blood of Jesus cleanseth me,
    Cleanseth, cleanseth, 
    O, yes, it cleanseth me."

    2.
    At the door of faith I entered in,
    And to him confessed my guilt and sin;
    With his own dear hand he washed me clean,
    He washed me white as snow.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Tho' my heart was all I had to give,
    Yet he smiled and bade me look and live;
    What a calm, sweet peace did I receive!
    He washed me white as snow.  [Chorus]

    4.
    I will sing his pow'r from death to save,
    I will sing his triumph o'er the grave,
    I will sing beyond death's chilling wave,
    "He washed me white as snow."  [Chorus]
