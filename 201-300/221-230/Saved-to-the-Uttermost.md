    1.
    Sav'd to the uttermost:  I am the Lord's
    Jesus, my Saviour, salvation affords;
    Gives me his Spirit, a witness within,
    Whisp'ring of pardon, and saving from sin.

    Refrain:
    Sav'd, sav'd, sav'd to the uttermost,
    Sav'd, sav'd by power divine;
    Sav'd, sav'd, sav'd to the uttermost,
    Jesus, the Saviour, is mine!

    2.
    Sav'd to the uttermost:  Jesus is near;
    Keeping me safely, he casteth out fear;
    Trusting his promises, now I am blest;
    Leaning upon him, how sweet is my rest.  [Refrain]

    3.
    Sav'd to the uttermost:  this I can say,
    "Once all was darkness, but now it is day;
    Beautiful visions of glory I see,
    Jesus in brightness reveal'd unto me.  [Refrain]

    4.
    Sav'd to the uttermost:  cheerfully sing
    Loud halleluias to Jesus, my King!
    Ransomed and pardoned, redeemed by his blood,
    Cleans'd from unrighteousness:  glory to God!  [Refrain]
