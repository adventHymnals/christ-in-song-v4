    1.
    Jesus, keep me near the cross,
    There a precious fountain
    Free to all, a healing stream,
    Flows from Calv'ry's mountain.

    Chorus:
    In the cross, in the cross,
    Be my glory ever;
    Till my raptur'd soul shall find
    Rest beyond the river.

    2.
    Near the cross, a trembling soul,
    Love and mercy found me;
    There the bright and Morning Star
    Sheds its beams around me.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Near the cross!  O Lamb of God,
    Bring its scenes before me;
    Help me walk from day to day,
    With its shadows o'er me.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
    Hoping, trusting ever;
    Till I reach the golden strand,
    Just beyond the river.  [Chorus]
