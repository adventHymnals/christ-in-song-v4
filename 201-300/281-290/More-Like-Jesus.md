    1.
    More like Jesus would I be;
    Let my Saviour dwell with me,
    Fill my soul with peace and love,
    Make me gentle as a dove;
    More like Jesus while I go,
    Pilgrim in this world below;
    Poor in Spirit would I be
    Let my Saviour dwell in me.

    2.
    If he hears the raven's cry;
    If his ever watchful eye
    Marks the sparrows when they fall,
    Surely he will hear my call,
    He will teach me how to live,
    All my simple tho'ts forgive;
    Pure in heart I still would be
    Let my Saviour dwell in me.

    3.
    More like Jesus when I pray,
    More like Jesus day by day;
    May I rest me by his side,
    Where the tranquil waters glide;
    Born of him, thro' grace renew'd,
    By his love my will subdued,
    Rich in faith I still would be
    Let my Saviour dwell in me.
