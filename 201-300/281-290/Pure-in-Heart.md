    1.
    Saviour, keep me pure in heart,
    By thy pow'r renewing;
    Seal my life of thine a part,
    All my tho'ts bedewing.

    Refrain:
    Pure in heart, pure in heart,
    Jesus, only giver;
    Seal my life of thine a part,
    Here and then forever.

    2.
    In thy sinless life I see
    Matchless grace and beauty:
    Perfect Pattern, guide for me,
    Teaching love for duty.  [Refrain]

    3.
    One with thee!  thus would I live,
    Till the morn immortal;
    Thus myself for others give,
    With them pass the portal.  [Refrain]
