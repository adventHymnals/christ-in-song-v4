    1.
    Since on my Saviour I believed,
    His beams around me shine;
    The Spirit's witness I received,
    I know that He is mine.

    Chorus:
    "I know whom I have believed,
    and am persuaded that He is able
    To keep what I have committed
    unto Him against that day."

    2.
    I know His love, His faithful care;
    His mighty saving pow'r;
    His willingness to answer pray'r,
    His grace in sun and show'r.  [Chorus]

    3.
    In His dear wounded hands I leave
    All that concerneth me;
    The flow'rs that please, the thorns that grieve,
    Shall fraught with blessing be.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Tho' all things else should pass away,
    He changeless, would remain.
    So will I sing, till dawns His day,
    Faith's jubilant refrain.  [Chorus]
