[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1msf9TWlEU1C1qY%2DKdJ1ZRuB6vxbcAVsU/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,
    And it told Thy love to me;
    But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
    And be closer drawn to Thee.

    Refrain:
    Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
    To the cross where Thou hast died;
    Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
    To Thy precious, bleeding side.

    2.
    Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,
    By the pow'r of grace divine;
    May my soul look up with a steadfast hope
    And my will be lost in Thine.  [Refrain]

    3.
    O the pure delight of a single hour
    That before Thy throne I spend,
    When I kneel in pray'r, and with Thee, my God,
    I commune as friend with friend!  [Refrain]

    4.
    There are depths of love that I cannot know
    Till I cross the narrow sea;
    There are heights of joy that I may not reach
    Till I rest in peace with Thee.  [Refrain]
