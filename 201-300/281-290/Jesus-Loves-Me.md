    1.
    Jesus loves me!  this I know,
    For the Bible tells me so;
    Little ones to Him belong,
    They are weak, but He is strong.

    Chorus:
    Yes, Jesus loves me,
    Yes, Jesus loves me;
    Yes, Jesus loves me,
    The Bible tells me so.

    2.
    Jesus loves me!  He who died,
    Heaven's gate to open wide;
    He will wash away my sin.
    Let His little child come in.  [Chorus]

    3.
    Jesus loves me!  loves me still,
    When I'm sad or weak and ill;
    From His shining throne on high,
    Comes to watch me where I lie.  [Chorus]

    4.
    Jesus loves me; He will stay,
    Close beside me all the way,
    If I love Him, by and by
    He will take me home on high.  [Chorus]
