[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDVwZK3s2%2DCcJ%2DUcqNmO0wI6q78NOTYV/edit?mode=html)



    1.
    For all the saints who from their labors rest,
    Who Thee by faith before the world confessed,
    Thy Name, O Jesus, be for ever blest,
    Alleluia!  Alleluia!

    2.
    Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress, and their Might;
    Thou, Lord, their Captain, in the well-fought fight;
    Thou, in the darkness their true guiding Light. 
    Alleluia!  Alleluia!

    3.
    O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,
    Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,
    And win with them the victor's crown of gold.
    Alleluia!  Alleluia!

    4.
    And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,
    Steals on the ears the distant triumph song,
    And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong. 
    Alleluia!  Alleluia!
