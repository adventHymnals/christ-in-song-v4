    1.
    O for a thousand tongues to sing:
    Blessed be the name of the Lord!
    The glories of my God and King,
    Blessed be the name of the Lord!

    Chorus:
    Blessed be the name,
    Blessed be the name,
    Blessed be the name of the Lord.
    Blessed be the name,
    Blessed be the name,
    Blessed be the name of the Lord.

    2.
    Jesus, the name that charms our fears,
    Blessed be the name of the Lord!
    'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
    Blessed be the name of the Lord!  [Chorus]

    3.
    He breaks the pow'r of cancelled sin,
    Blessed be the name of the Lord!
    His blood can make the foulest clean,
    Blessed be the name of the Lord!  [Chorus]
