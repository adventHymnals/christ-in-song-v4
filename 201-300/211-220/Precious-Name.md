    1.
    Take the name of Jesus with you,
    Child of sorrow and of woe;
    It will joy and comfort give you,
    Take it, then, where'er you go.  

    Refrain:
    Precious name, O how sweet!
    Hope of earth and joy of heav'n;
    Precious name, O how sweet!
    Hope of earth and joy of heav'n.

    2.
    Take the name of Jesus ever,
    As a shield from ev'ry snare;
    If temptations 'round you gather,
    Breathe that holy name in pray'r.  [Refrain]

    3.
    O the precious name of Jesus!
    How it thrills our souls with joy,
    When his loving arms receive us,
    And his songs our tongues employ!  [Refrain]

    4.
    At the name of Jesus bowing,
    Falling prostrate at his feet,
    King of kings in heav'n we'll crown him,
    When our journey is complete.  [Refrain]
