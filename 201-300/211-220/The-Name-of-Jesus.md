    1.
    The name of Jesus is so sweet,
    I know its music to repeat;
    It makes my joys full and complete,
    The precious name of Jesus.

    Chorus:
    "Jesus," oh, how sweet the name!
    "Jesus," ev'ry day the same;
    "Jesus," let all saints proclaim
    Its worthy praise forever.

    2.
    I love the name of Him whose heart
    Knows all my griefs and bears a part;
    Who bids all anxious fears depart
    I love the name of Jesus.  [Chorus]

    3.
    That name I fondly love to hear,
    It never fails my heart to cheer,
    Its music dries the falling tears;
    Exalt the name of Jesus.  [Chorus]

    4.
    No word of man can ever tell
    How sweet the name I love so well;
    Oh, let its praise ever swell,
    Oh, praise the name of Jesus.  [Chorus]
