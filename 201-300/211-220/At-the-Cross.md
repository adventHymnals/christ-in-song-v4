    1.
    Alas!  and did my Saviour bleed,
    And did my Sov'reign die?
    Would he devote that sacred head 
    For such a worm as I?

    Chorus:
    At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light,
    And the burden of my heart rolled away,
    It was there by faith I received my sight,
    And now I am happy all the day.

    2.
    Was it for deeds that I have done,
    He groaned upon the tree?
    Amazing pity, grace unknown,
    And love beyond degree!  [Chorus]

    3.
    But drops of grief can ne'er repay
    The debt of love I owe;
    Here, Lord I give myself away,
    'Tis all that I can do!  [Chorus]
