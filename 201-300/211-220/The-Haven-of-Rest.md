    1.
    My soul in sad exile was out on life's sea,
    So burdened with sin, and distressed,
    Till I heard a sweet voice saying, "Make me your choice;"
    And I entered the "Haven of Rest!"

    Chorus:
    I've anchored my soul in the "Haven of Rest,"
    I sail the wide seas no more;
    The tempest may sweep o'er the wild, stormy deep,
    In Jesus I'm safe evermore.

    2.
    I yield myself to his tender embrace,
    And faith taking hold of his Word,
    My fetters fell off, and I anchored my soul:
    The Haven of Rest is my Lord.  [Chorus]

    3.
    The song of my soul, since the Lord made me whole,
    Has been the OLD STORY so blest,
    Of Jesus, who'll save whosoever will have
    A home in the "Haven of Rest!"  [Chorus]

    4.
    How precious the tho't that we all may recline,
    Like John the beloved and blest,
    On Jesus' strong arm, where no tempest can harm,
    Secure in the "Haven of Rest!"  [Chorus]

    5.
    O come to the Saviour!  he patiently waits
    To save by his power divine;
    Come, anchor your soul in the "Haven of Rest,"
    And say, "my Beloved is mine."  [Chorus]
