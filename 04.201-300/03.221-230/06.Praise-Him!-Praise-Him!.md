Praise Him!  praise Him!  Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
Sing, O earth His wonderful love proclaim!
Hail Him!  hail Him!  highest archangels in glory;
Strength and honor give to His holy name!
Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children,
In His arms He carries them all day long;
Praise Him!  praise Him!  tell of His excellent greatness;
Praise Him!  praise Him ever in joyful song!

2.
Praise Him!  praise Him!  Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
For our sins He suffered, and bled and died;
He our Rock, our hope of eternal salvation,
Hail Him!  hail Him!  Jesus, the crucified.
Sound His praises!  Jesus who bore our sorrows,
Love unbounded, wonderful, deep and strong;
Praise Him!  praise Him!  tell of His excellent greatness;
Praise Him!  praise Him ever in joyful song!

3.
Praise Him!  praise Him!  Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
Heav'nly portals, loud with hosannas ring!
Jesus, Saviour, reigneth forever and ever:
Crown Him!  crown Him!  Prophet, and Priest, and King!
Christ is coming over the world victorious,
Pow'r and glory unto the Lord belong;
Praise Him!  praise him!  tell of His excellent greatness;
Praise Him!  praise Him ever in joyful song!
