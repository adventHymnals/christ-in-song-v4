```txt
1.
Since Christ my soul from sin set free,
This world has been a heav'n to me;
And 'mid earth's sorrow and its woe,
'Tis heav'n my Jesus here to know.

Chorus:
O hallelujah!  yes, 'tis heav'n,
'Tis heav'n to know my sins forgiv'n;
On land or sea, what matters where?
Where Jesus is, 'tis heaven there.

2.
Once heaven seemed a far-off place,
Till Jesus showed His smiling face;
Now 'tis begun within my soul,
To last while endless ages roll.  [Chorus]

3.
What matters where on earth we dwell?
On mountain top, or in the dell,
In cottage, or a mansion fair,
Where Jesus is, 'tis heaven there.  [Chorus]
