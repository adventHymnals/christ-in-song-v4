1.
Sav'd to the uttermost:  I am the Lord's
Jesus, my Saviour, salvation affords;
Gives me his Spirit, a witness within,
Whisp'ring of pardon, and saving from sin.

Refrain:
Sav'd, sav'd, sav'd to the uttermost,
Sav'd, sav'd by power divine;
Sav'd, sav'd, sav'd to the uttermost,
Jesus, the Saviour, is mine!

2.
Sav'd to the uttermost:  Jesus is near;
Keeping me safely, he casteth out fear;
Trusting his promises, now I am blest;
Leaning upon him, how sweet is my rest.  [Refrain]

3.
Sav'd to the uttermost:  this I can say,
"Once all was darkness, but now it is day;
Beautiful visions of glory I see,
Jesus in brightness reveal'd unto me.  [Refrain]

4.
Sav'd to the uttermost:  cheerfully sing
Loud halleluias to Jesus, my King!
Ransomed and pardoned, redeemed by his blood,
Cleans'd from unrighteousness:  glory to God!  [Refrain]
