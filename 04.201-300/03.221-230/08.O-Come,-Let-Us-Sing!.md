####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O come, let us sing unto the Lord;
Let us heartily rejoice in the Strength of our Salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving,
And show ourselves glad in him with psalms.

2.
For the Lord is a great God,
And a great King above all gods.
In his hand are all the corners of the earth,
And the strength of the hills is his also.

3.
The sea is his, and he made it;
And his hands prepared the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down,
Let us kneel before the Lord, our Maker.
