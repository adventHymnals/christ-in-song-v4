1.
Come, children, hail the Prince of Peace
Obey the Saviour's call;
Come, seek His face and taste His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Chorus:
In the dewy time of youth, let us come,
Before the brown leaves fall;
He will guide us with His truth, let us come,
And crown Him Lord of all.

2.
Ye lambs of Christ, your tribute bring,
Ye children, great and small;
Hosanna sing to Christ your King,
And crown Him Lord of all.  [Chorus]

3.
This Jesus will your sins forgive,
O haste!  before Him fall;
For you He died, that you might live
To crown Him Lord of all.  [Chorus]
