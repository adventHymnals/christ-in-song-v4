####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious,
See the Man of Sorrows now;
From the fight returned victorious,
Ev'ry knee to Him shall bow;
Crown Him, crown Him, crown Him, crown Him,
Crowns become the victor's brow.

2.
Crown the Saviour, angels crown Him,
Rich the trophies Jesus brings;
On the seat of pow'r enthrone Him,
While the vault of heaven rings;
Crown Him, crown Him, crown Him, crown Him, 
Crown the Saviour King of kings.

3.
Sinners in derision crowned Him,
Mocking thus the Saviour's claim;
Saints and angels crowd around Him,
Own His title, praise His name;
Crown Him, crown Him, crown Him, crown Him,
Spread abroad the victor's fame.

4.
Hark!  those bursts of acclamation;
Hark!  those loud triumphant chords;
Jesus takes the highest station;
Oh, what joy the sight affords!
Crown Him, crown Him, crown Him, crown Him,
King of kings, and Lord of lords.
