1.
'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,
And we gather to Jesus, our Saviour and Friend;
If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,
What a balm for the weary!  O how sweet to be there!

Chorus:  Blessed hour of prayer,
Blessed hour of prayer,
What a balm for the weary!
O how sweet to be there!

2.
'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Saviour draws near,
With a tender compassion His children to hear;
When He tells us we may cast at His feet ev'ry care,
What a balm for the weary!  O how sweet to be there!  [Chorus]

3.
'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried
To the Saviour who loves them their sorrows confide;
With a sympathizing heart He removes ev'ry care;
What a balm for the weary!  O how sweet to be there!  [Chorus]

4.
At the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe
That the blessings we're needing we'll surely receive,
In the fulness of this trust we shall lose ev'ry care;
What a balm for the weary!  O how sweet to be there!  [Chorus]
