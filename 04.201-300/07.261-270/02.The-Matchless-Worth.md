        Christ in Song 262. The Matchless Worth. O could I speak the matchless worth, O could I sound the glories forth, Which in my Saviour shine! I'd soar and touch the heav'nly strings, And view with Gabriel while he sings In notes almost divine, In notes almost divine.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O could I speak the matchless worth,
O could I sound the glories forth,
Which in my Saviour shine!
I'd soar and touch the heav'nly strings,
And view with Gabriel while he sings
In notes almost divine,
In notes almost divine.

2.
I'd sing the precious blood he spilt,
My ransom from the dreadful guilt
Of sin and wrath divine!
I'd sing his glorious righteousness,
In which all perfect heav'nly dress
My soul shall ever shine,
My soul shall ever shine.

3.
I'd sing the character he bears,
And all the forms of love he wears,
Exalted on his throne;
In loftiest songs of sweetest praise,
I would to everlasting days
Make all his glories known,
Make all his glories known.

4.
Well, the delightful day will come,
When my dear Lord will take me home,
And I shall see his face;
Then, with my Saviour, Brother, Friend,
A blest eternity I'll spend,
Triumphant in his grace,
Triumphant in his grace.
