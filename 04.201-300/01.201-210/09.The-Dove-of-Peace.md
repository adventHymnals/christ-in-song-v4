####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The dove of peace sings in my heart,
"In strife and war thou hast no part;
Thy place among the hosts of wrong
Is but to echo love's sweet song."

Refrain:
The dove of peace sings in my soul,
"Thy Saviour's blood doth make thee whole;"
The Spirit's voice, like wooing dove,
Sings of my Saviour's deathless love.

2.
The dove of peace hath radiant wings,
And light and melody he brings;
He tells of my soon-coming King,
Of praises that the angels sing.  [Refrain]

3.
O gentle voice of Jesus' love!
It links the life to heav'n above,
And thro' all sorrow and all wrong
O'erflows the soul with tender song.  [Refrain]

4.
The dove of peace shall ne'er depart,
But keep his home within my heart.
E'en when I rise to worlds above,
I'll hear the singing of the dove.  [Refrain]

5.
O wouldst thou hear the dove within?
Let Jesus cleanse thy heart from sin:
Then in sweet measures from above
Thou'lt hear the music of his love.  [Refrain]
