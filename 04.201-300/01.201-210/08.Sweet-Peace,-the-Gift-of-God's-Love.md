####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
There comes to my heart one sweet strain,
A glad and a joyous refrain,
I sing it again and again,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

Chorus:
Peace, peace, sweet peace
Wonderful gift from above
Oh, wonderful, wonderful peace,
Sweet peace the gift of God's love.

2.
Thro' Christ on the cross peace was made,
My debt by His death was all paid,
No other foundation is laid,
For peace, the gift of God's love.  [Chorus]

3.
When Jesus as Lord I had crowned,
My heart with this peace did abound,
In Him the rich blessing I found,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.  [Chorus]

4.
In Jesus for peace I abide,
And as I keep close to His side,
There's nothing but peace doth betide,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.  [Chorus]
