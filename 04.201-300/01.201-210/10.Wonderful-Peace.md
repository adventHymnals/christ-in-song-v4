```txt
1.
Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight,
Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm;
In celestial like strains it unceasingly falls
O'er my soul like an infinite calm.

Chorus:
Peace!  peace!  wonderful peace,
Coming down from the Father above;
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray,
In fathomless billows of love.

2.
What a treasure I have in this wonderful peace,
Buried deep in my innermost soul;
So secure that no power can mine it away,
While the years of eternity roll!  [Chorus]

3.
I am resting to-night in this wonderful peace,
Resting sweetly in Jesus' control;
I am kept from all danger by night and by day,
And his glory is flooding my soul.  [Chorus]

4.
I believe when I rise to that city of peace,
Where the Author of peace I shall see,
That one strain of the song which the ransomed will sing,
In that heavenly kingdom will be,  [Chorus]

5.
Weary soul, without gladness or comfort or rest,
Passing down the rough pathway of time!
Make the Saviour your friend ere the shadows grow dark;
O accept of this peace so sublime.  [Chorus]

```
