Chorus: They are all taken away, They are all taken away; He will mention them no more forever; Praise the Lord!  sing it all day. They are all taken away, They are all taken away; I am resting in the great Peace Giver,  My sins are all taken away.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
He will mention them no more forever,
My sins are all taken away;
For his royal promise changes never,
My sins are all taken away.

Chorus:
They are all taken away,
They are all taken away;
He will mention them no more forever;
Praise the Lord!  sing it all day.
They are all taken away,
They are all taken away;
I am resting in the great Peace Giver, 
My sins are all taken away.

2.
Since I came by faith to Calv'ry's mountain,
My sins are all taken away;
Thro' the cleansing pow'r of that blest Fountain,
My sins are all taken away.  [Chorus]

3.
At the bottom of the sea they're lying,
My sins are all taken away;
Now the pow'rs of sin and self denying,
My sins are all taken away.  [Chorus]

4.
Once the "carnal mind" was all my pleasure,
My sins are all taken away;
Now the word of God is my chief treasure,
My sins are all taken away.  [Chorus]

5.
Doubt can never stay where Faith is singing,
"My sins are all taken away;"
"Praise the Lord" within my heart is ringing,
My sins are all taken away.  [Chorus]
