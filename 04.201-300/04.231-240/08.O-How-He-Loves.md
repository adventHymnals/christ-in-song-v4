#### Advent Hymnals
## 238. O HOW HE LOVES
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
One there is above all others,
O how He loves!
His is love beyond a brother's,
O how He loves!
Earthly friends may fail or leave us,
One day soothe, the next day grieve us;
But this Friend will ne'er deceive us,
O how He loves!

2.
'Tis eternal life to know Him,
O how He loves!
Think, O think how much we owe Him,
O how He loves!
With His precious blood He bought us,
In the wilderness He sought us,
To His fold He safely brought us,
O how He loves!

3.
Blessed Jesus!  would you know Him,
O how He loves!
Give yourselves entirely to Him,
O how He loves!
Leave the past for bright tomorrow,
From His word now courage borrow,
Jesus carries all your sorrow, 
O how He loves!

4.
Thro' His name we are forgiven,
O how He loves!
Backward shall our foes be driven,
O how He loves!
Best of blessings He'll provide us,
Naught but good shall e'er betide us,
Safe to glory He will guide us,
O how He loves!
