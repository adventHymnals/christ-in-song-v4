I have a song I love to sing,
Since I have been redeem'd;
Of my Redeemer, my Saviour, King,
Since I have been redeem'd.

Since I have been redeem'd,
Since I have been redeem'd, 
I will glory in His name;
Since I have been redeem'd,

Since I have been redeem'd;
To do His will my highest prize,
Since I have been redeem'd.  [Chorus]

Since I have been redeem'd;
Dispelling ev'ry doubt and fear,
Since I have been redeem'd.  [Chorus]

Since I have been redeem'd;
Where I shall dwell eternally,
Since I have been redeem'd.  [Chorus]
