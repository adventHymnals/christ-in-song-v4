```txt
1.
Jesus, Thou hast promised
That where two or three
In Thy name have gathered,
Thou wilt present be;
And Thy word believing,
Now in pray'r we kneel;
Jesus, come and bless us;
Lord, Thyself reveal.

Chorus:
Jesus, come and bless us
While we linger here;
Jesus, come and bless us,
Be Thou ever near.

2.
Jesus, Thou hast met us
Oft in seasons past,
But we need Thy presence
With us till the last;
Come, O blessed Saviour,
And Thy grace display;
Hear us and accept us;
Bless us while we pray.  [Chorus]

3.
Jesus, tune our voices
To Thy songs of praise;
Be in each petition
That to Thee we raise:
May our faith grow stronger,
And our hope more bright;
May our love be purer,
And our path more light.  [Chorus]
