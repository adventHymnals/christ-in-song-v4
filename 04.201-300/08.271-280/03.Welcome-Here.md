####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Children singing, sweet bells ringing!
Welcome, welcome, happy day!
Pray'rs of thousands now are winging
Up to heav'n their silent way.

Chorus:
Welcome, welcome, joyous welcome;
Teachers, scholars, welcome here!

2.
'Tis an hour of happy meeting,
We have met for praise and pray'r;
But the hour is short and fleeting;
This is why we're early here.  [Chorus]

3.
We'll not keep our teachers waiting,
While we tarry by the way,
Nor disturb the school reciting,
'Tis the holy Sabbath day.  [Chorus]
