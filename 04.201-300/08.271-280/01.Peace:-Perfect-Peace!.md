#### Advent Hymnals
## 271. PEACE:  PERFECT PEACE!
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Peace!  perfect peace!  in this dark world of sin;
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.

2.
Peace!  perfect peace!  by thronging duties pressed;
To do the will of Jesus, this is rest.

3.
Peace!  perfect peace!  with sorrows surging round;
On Jesus' bosom naught but calm is found.

4.
Peace!  perfect peace!  with loved ones far away;
In Jesus' keeping we are safe, and they.

5.
Peace!  perfect peace!  our future all unknown;
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.

6.
Peace!  perfect peace!  death shadowing us and ours;
Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers.

7.
It is enough:  earth's struggle soon shall cease,
And Jesus call to heaven's perfect peace.

```
