1.
Strains of music often greet me,
As I join the busy throng,
But there's nothing half so pleasant,
As the holy Sabbath song.

Chorus:
No fear of ill, no fear or wrong,
While I can sing my Sabbath song:
My Sabbath song, my Sabbath song,
I love to sing my Sabbath song.

2.
'Tis a song of love and mercy,
Speaking peace to all mankind,
Telling sinners poor and needy,
Where the Saviour they may find.  [Chorus]

3.
While I love, O may I ever
Love the holy Sabbath song,
And in yonder home eternal, 
Sing it with the blood bought throng.  [Chorus]
