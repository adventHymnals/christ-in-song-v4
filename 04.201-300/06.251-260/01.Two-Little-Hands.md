1.
I've two little hands to work for Jesus,
One little tongue his praise to tell,
Two little ears to hear his counsel,
One little voice a song to swell.

Chorus:
Lord, we come, Lord, we come,
In our childhood's early morning,
Lord, we come, Lord, we come,
Come to learn of thee.

2.
I've two little feet to tread the pathway
Up to the heav'nly courts above;
Two little eyes to read the Bible,
Telling of Jesus' wondrous love.  [Chorus]

3.
I've one little heart to give to Jesus,
One little soul for him to save,
One little life for his dear service,
One little self that he must have.  [Chorus]
