        Christ in Song 286. More Like Jesus. More like Jesus would I be; Let my Saviour dwell with me, Fill my soul with peace and love, Make me gentle as a dove; More like Jesus while I go, Pilgrim in this world below; Poor in Spirit would I be Let my Saviour dwell in me.

## 286. MORE LIKE JESUS
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
More like Jesus would I be;
Let my Saviour dwell with me,
Fill my soul with peace and love,
Make me gentle as a dove;
More like Jesus while I go,
Pilgrim in this world below;
Poor in Spirit would I be
Let my Saviour dwell in me.

2.
If he hears the raven's cry;
If his ever watchful eye
Marks the sparrows when they fall,
Surely he will hear my call,
He will teach me how to live,
All my simple tho'ts forgive;
Pure in heart I still would be
Let my Saviour dwell in me.

3.
More like Jesus when I pray,
More like Jesus day by day;
May I rest me by his side,
Where the tranquil waters glide;
Born of him, thro' grace renew'd,
By his love my will subdued,
Rich in faith I still would be
Let my Saviour dwell in me.
