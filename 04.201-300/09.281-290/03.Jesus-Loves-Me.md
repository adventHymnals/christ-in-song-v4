####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Jesus loves me!  this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong,
They are weak, but He is strong.

Chorus:
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me;
Yes, Jesus loves me,
The Bible tells me so.

2.
Jesus loves me!  He who died,
Heaven's gate to open wide;
He will wash away my sin.
Let His little child come in.  [Chorus]

3.
Jesus loves me!  loves me still,
When I'm sad or weak and ill;
From His shining throne on high,
Comes to watch me where I lie.  [Chorus]

4.
Jesus loves me; He will stay,
Close beside me all the way,
If I love Him, by and by
He will take me home on high.  [Chorus]

```
