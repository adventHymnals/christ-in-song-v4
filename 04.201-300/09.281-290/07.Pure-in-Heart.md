## 287. PURE IN HEART
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
Saviour, keep me pure in heart,
By thy pow'r renewing;
Seal my life of thine a part,
All my tho'ts bedewing.

Refrain:
Pure in heart, pure in heart,
Jesus, only giver;
Seal my life of thine a part,
Here and then forever.

2.
In thy sinless life I see
Matchless grace and beauty:
Perfect Pattern, guide for me,
Teaching love for duty.  [Refrain]

3.
One with thee!  thus would I live,
Till the morn immortal;
Thus myself for others give,
With them pass the portal.  [Refrain]
