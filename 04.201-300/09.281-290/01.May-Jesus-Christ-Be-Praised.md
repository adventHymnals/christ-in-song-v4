## 281. MAY JESUS CHRIST BE PRAISED
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
When morning gilds the skies,
My heart awaking cries,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Alike at work and pray'r,
To Jesus I repair:
May Jesus Christ be praised!

2.
Does sadness fill my mind,
A solace here I find,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Or fades my earthly bliss,
My comfort still is this,
May Jesus Christ be praised!

3.
Do evil tho'ts molest?
With this I shield my breast,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
The pow'rs of darkness fear,
When this sweet chant they hear
May Jesus Christ be praised!

4.
Be this, while life is mine,
My canticle divine,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Be this the eternal song
Thro' all the ages long,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
