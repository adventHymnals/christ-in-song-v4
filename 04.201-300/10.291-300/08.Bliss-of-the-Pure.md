        Christ in Song 298. Bliss of the Pure. O bliss of the pure ones! O bliss of the free! I've plung'd in the fountain once open'd for me! O'er sin and uncleanness exulting I stand, And point to the nailprints in his holy hands, And point to the nailprints in his holy hands.

####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O bliss of the pure ones!
O bliss of the free!
I've plung'd in the fountain once open'd for me!
O'er sin and uncleanness exulting I stand,
And point to the nailprints in his holy hands,
And point to the nailprints in his holy hands.

2.
O bliss of the sav'd ones!
Christ Jesus is mine!
No more condemnation; no longer I pine.
In conscious salvation I sing of his grace
Who lifted upon me the smiles of his face,
Who lifted upon me the smiles of his face.

3.
O bliss of the glad ones!
O bliss of the pure!
No wound hath the spirit that he can not cure;
No head bow'd with sorrow but sweetly may rest,
No tears but may vanish on his loving breast,
No tears but may vanish on his loving breast.

4.
O Crucified Jesus!  of thee will I sing,
My blessed Redeemer, my God and my King;
My soul fill'd with rapture, shall shout o'er the grave;
In him will I triumph, the "Mighty to Save!"  
In him will I triumph, the "Mighty to Save!"
