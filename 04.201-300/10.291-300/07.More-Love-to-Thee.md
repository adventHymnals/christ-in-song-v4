####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
More love to thee, O Christ!
More love to thee;
Hear thou the pray'r I make
On bended knee.
This is my earnest plea,
More love, O Christ, to thee,
More love to thee!
More love to thee!

2.
Once earthly joy I craved,
Sought peace and rest;
Now thee alone I seek,
Give what is best.
This all my pray'r shall be,
More love, O Christ, to thee,
More love to thee!
More love to thee!

3.
Let sorrow do its work,
Send grief or pain;
Sweet are thy messengers,
Sweet their refrain,
When they can sing with me,
More love, O Christ, to thee,
More love to thee!
More love to thee!

3.
Then shall my latest breath,
Whisper thy praise;
This be the parting cry
My heart shall raise,
This still its pray'r shall be:
More love, O Christ, to thee,
More love to thee!
More love to thee!
