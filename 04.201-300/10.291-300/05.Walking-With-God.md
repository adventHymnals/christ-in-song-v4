## 295. WALKING WITH GOD
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
O let me walk with thee, my God,
As Enoch walked in days of old;
Place thou my trembling hand in thine,
And sweet communion with me hold;
E'en tho' the path I May not see,
Yet, Jesus, let me walk with thee.

2.
I can not, dare not walk alone;
The tempest rages in the sky;
A thousand snares beset my feet,
A thousand foes are lurking nigh;
Still thou the raging of the sea;
O Master, let me walk with thee.

3.
If I may rest my hand in thine,
I'll count the joys of earth but loss,
And firmly, bravely journey on;
I'll bear the banner of the cross
Till Zion's glorious gates I see:
Yet, Saviour, let me walk with thee.
