```txt
1.
Down at the cross where my Saviour died,
Down where for cleansing from sin I cried,
There to my heart was the blood applied.
Glory to his name.

Chorus:
Glory to his name,
Glory to his name.
There to my heart was the blood applied,
Glory to his name.

2.
I am so wondrously saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly abides within,
There at the cross where he took me in,
Glory to his name.  [Chorus]

3.
O precious Fountain that saves from sin!
I am so glad I have entered in,
There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean.
Glory to his name.  [Chorus]

4.
Come to this Fountain so rich and sweet,
Cast thy poor soul at the Saviour's feet,
Plunge in today and be made complete, 
Glory to his name.  [Chorus]
