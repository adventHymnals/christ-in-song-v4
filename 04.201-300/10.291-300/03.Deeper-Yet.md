## 293. DEEPER YET
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
In the blood from the cross
I have been wash'd from sin;
But to be free from dross
Still I would enter in.

Chorus:
Deeper, yet, deeper yet,
Into the crimson flood;
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Under the precious blood.

2.
Day by day, hour by hour
Blessings are sent to me;
But for more of His pow'r
Ever my pray'r shall be.  [Chorus]

3.
Near to Christ I would live,
Following Him each day;
What I ask He will give,
So then with faith I pray.  [Chorus]

4.
Now I have peace, sweet peace,
While in this world of sin;
But to pray I'll not cease
Till I am pure within.  [Chorus]

```
