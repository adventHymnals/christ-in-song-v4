## 294. THE SOLID ROCK
####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

Refrain:
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

2.
When darkness seems to veil his face,
I rest on his unchanging grace;
In ev'ry high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the vail.  [Refrain]

3.
His oath, his covenant, and blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.  [Refrain]

4.
When he shall come with trumpet sound,
O may I then in him be found;
Clad in his righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.  [Refrain]
