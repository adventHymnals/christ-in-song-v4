```txt
1.
My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine,
For thee all the follies of sin I resign;
My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art thou;
If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

2.
I love thee, because thou hast first loved me,
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
I love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow;
If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

3.
I'll love thee in life, and I'll love thee in death;
I'll praise thee as long as thou lendest me breath,
And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow,
If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

4.
In mansions of glory and endless delight,
I'll ever adore thee in heaven so bright,
And sing with the glittering crown on my brow,
If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
