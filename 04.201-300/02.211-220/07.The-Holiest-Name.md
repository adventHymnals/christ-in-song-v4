```txt
1.
Dearest name in earth or heaven,
Sweetest name my heart hath known,
By the Father it was given
To his well beloved Son.

Chorus:
'Tis the holiest name,
'Tis the holiest name;
From the Father's lips to the earth it came.
Bro't by angels of light,
In the stillness of night,
Was the dear, dear name of Jesus.

2.
To my heart it brings a blessing,
And my lips take up the strain,
And his wond'rous name confessing,
Tell its sweetness o'er again.  [Chorus]

3.
Oh, my soul would swell the chorus,
Singing his redeeming love,
And ascribe eternal praises
To the name all names above.  [Chorus]
