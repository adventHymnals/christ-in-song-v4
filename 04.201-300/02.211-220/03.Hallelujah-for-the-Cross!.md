####  Christ in Song,

```txt
1.
The cross!  it standeth fast,
Hallelujah!  hallelujah!
Defying ev'ry blast,
Hallelujah!  hallelujah!  
The winds of hell have blown,
The world its hate hath shown,
Yet 'tis not overthrown,
Hallelujah for the cross!
Yet 'tis not overthrown,
Hallelujah for the cross!

Chorus:
Hallelujah forever!  
It never shall suffer loss,
Hallelujah forever!
We glory in the grand old cross.

2.
It is the old cross still,
Hallelujah!  hallelujah!
Its triumph let us tell,
Hallelujah!  hallelujah!
The grace of God here shone
Thro' Christ the blessed Son,
Who did for sin atone,
Hallelujah for the cross!
Who did for sin atone,
Hallelujah for the cross!  [Chorus]

3.
'Twas here the debt was paid,
Hallelujah!  hallelujah!
Our sin on Jesus laid,
Hallelujah!  hallelujah!
So round the cross we sing
Of Christ our Offering,
Of Christ our living King,
Hallelujah for the cross!
Of Christ our living King,
Hallelujah for the cross!  [Chorus]
