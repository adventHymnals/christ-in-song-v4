```txt
1.
Alas!  and did my Saviour bleed,
And did my Sov'reign die?
Would he devote that sacred head 
For such a worm as I?

Chorus:
At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away,
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day.

2.
Was it for deeds that I have done,
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity, grace unknown,
And love beyond degree!  [Chorus]

3.
But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord I give myself away,
'Tis all that I can do!  [Chorus]
