1.
Do you know what the dewdrops say,
As they sparkle at break of day?
It is "Love, love, love,
Our God is a God of love;"
It is "Love, love, love,
Our God is a God of love."

2.
Do you know what the sunbeams bright,
Are singing from morning till night?
It is "love, love, love,
Our God is a God of love;"
It is "Love, love, love,
Our God is a God of love."

3.
Do you know what the soft rain tells,
As it tinkles like fairy bells?
It is "love, love, love,
Our God is a God of love;"
It is "Love, love, love,
Our God is a God of love."

4.
Do you know what the winds proclaim,
As they rustle the golden grain?
It is "love, love, love,
Our God is a God of love;"
It is "Love, love, love,
Our God is a God of love."
