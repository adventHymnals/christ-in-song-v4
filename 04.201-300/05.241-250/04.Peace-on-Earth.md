```txt
1.
"Peace upon earth!" the angels sang,
"Goodwill unto men!" the chorus rang,
"Glory to God!" the Christ has come,
His bright star shines in the clear blue dome.

Refrain:
Joyously sing, Joyously sing,
Joyously sing, Joyously sing!
Shout hallelujah to Christ, our King!

2.
"Peace upon earth!" 'tis sounding still,
"Glory unto God, to men good will!"
Bethlehem's song, 'tis caught from far,
And lifted up to that glowing star.  [Refrain]

3.
"Jesus has come!" it echoes wide,
Thro' valley and plain, on mountain side;
But not alone the angels sing,
For even children the anthem ring.  [Refrain]

4.
Yes!  let them sing, for Christ has laid 
His hand with a blessing on their head;
Sweeter to Him than angels' tones
Are songs that come from His little ones.  [Refrain]
