```txt
1.
"Called unto holiness," Church of our God,
Purchase of Jesus, redeemed by His blood;
Called from the world and its idols to flee,
Called from the bondage of sin to be free.

Chorus:
"Holiness unto the Lord" is our watchword and song,"
"Holiness unto the Lord" as we're marching along;
Sing it, shout it, loud and long,
"Holiness unto the Lord," now and forever.

2.
"Called unto holiness," children of light,
Walking with Jesus in garments of white;
Raiment unsullied, untarnished with sin,
God's Holy Spirit abiding within.  [Chorus]

3.
"Called unto holiness," praise His dear name!
This blessed secret to faith now made plain,
Not our own righteousness, but Christ within,
Living and reigning and saving from sin.  [Chorus]

4.
"Called unto holiness," glorious thought!
Up from the wilderness wanderings brought,
Out from the shadows and darkness of night,
Into the Canaan of perfect delight.  [Chorus]

5.
"Called unto holiness," Bride of the Lamb,
Waiting the Bridegroom's returning again;
Lift up your heads, for the day draweth near
When in His beauty the King shall appear.  [Chorus]
